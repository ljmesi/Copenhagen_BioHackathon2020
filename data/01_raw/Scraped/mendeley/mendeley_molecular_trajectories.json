Allosteric mutations that increase catalytic rates of these drug resistance enzymes have been identified in clinical isolates but are challenging to predict prospectively. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to predict allosteric mutants increasing CTX-M9 drug resistance, experimentally testing top mutants using multiple antibiotics. Purified enzymes show an increase in catalytic rate and efficiency, while mutant crystal structures show no detectable changes from wild-type CTX-M9. We hypothesize that increased drug resistance results from changes in the conformational ensemble of an acyl intermediate in hydrolysis. Machine-learning analyses on top-scoring mutants identify changes to the binding-pocket conformational ensemble by which these allosteric mutations transmit their effect. These findings show how molecular simulation can predict how allosteric mutations alter active-site conformational equilibria to increase catalytic rates and thus resistance against common clinically used antibiotics.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.ck3dh", "publicationDate": "2017-07-25", "dateAvailable": "2017-07-25", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ck3dh", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The intrinsic dynamics of these ribosome structures were obtained with anisotropic network model (ANM; codes available on https://github.com/Yuan-Yu/bioStructureM).  \n\nSecond, the pseudoknot structure was pulled into the mRNA entrance of the ribosome with steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations (trajectory provided here). The interaction forces between the pseudoknot and the mRNA entrance were calculated from SMD simulations, and combined with intrinsic dynamics from ANM using linear response theory (LRT; codes available on https://github.com/Yuan-Yu/bioStructureM). Interestingly, a rolling motion of 30S was observed.\n\nFinally, the tRNAs and their surroundings of the rolled structure were equilibrated with MD simulations.

Mutagenic studies suggest that MscL gating strongly depends on both intra-protein and interfacial lipid-protein interactions. However, there is a gap between this detailed chemical information and current mechanical models of MscL gating. Here, we investigate the MscL bilayer-protein interface through molecular dynamics simulations, and take a combined continuum-molecular approach to connect chemistry and mechanics. We quantify the effect of membrane tension on the forces acting on the surface of the channel, and identify interactions that may be critical in the force transduction between the membrane and MscL. We find that the local stress distribution on the protein surface is largely asymmetric, particularly under tension, with the cytoplasmic side showing significantly larger and more localized forces, which pull the protein radially outward. The molecular interactions that mediate this behavior arise from hydrogen bonds between the electronegative oxygens in the lipid headgroup and a cluster of positively charged lysine residues on the amphipathic S1 domain and the C-terminal end of the second trans-membrane helix. We take advantage of this strong interaction (estimated to be 10\u201313 kT per lipid) to actuate the channel (by applying forces on protein-bound lipids) and explore its sensitivity to the pulling magnitude and direction. We conclude by highlighting the simple motif that confers MscL with strong anchoring to the bilayer, and its presence in various integral membrane proteins including the human mechanosensitive channel K2P1 and bovine rhodopsin.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.ph510", "publicationDate": "2014-12-03", "dateAvailable": "2014-12-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ph510", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, the interpretation of experimental data from neutron scattering is oftentimes not trivial, partly because scattering methods probe ensemble-averaged information in the reciprocal space. Therefore, computer simulations, such as classical and ab initio molecular dynamics, are frequently used to unravel the time-dependent atomistic configurations that can reproduce the scattering patterns and thus assist in the understanding of the microscopic origin of certain properties of materials. LiquidLib is a post-processing package for analyzing the trajectory of atomistic simulations of liquids and liquid-like matter with application to neutron scattering experiments. From an atomistic simulation, LiquidLib provides the computation of various statistical quantities including the pair distribution function, the weighted and unweighted structure factors, the mean squared displacement, the non-Gaussian parameter, the four-point correlation function, the velocity auto correlation function, the self and collective van Hove correlation functions, the self and collective intermediate scattering functions, and the bond orientational order parameter. LiquidLib analyzes atomistic trajectories generated from packages such as LAMMPS, GROMACS, and VASP. It also offers an extendable platform to conveniently integrate new quantities into the library and integrate simulation trajectories of other file formats for analysis. Weighting the quantities by element-specific neutron-scattering lengths provides results directly comparable to neutron scattering measurements. Lastly, LiquidLib is independent of dimensionality, which allows analysis of trajectories in two, three, and higher dimensions. The code is beginning to find worldwide use.", "doi": "10.17632/tyggwp7656.1", "publicationDate": "2018-04-23", "dateAvailable": "2018-04-23", "version": "1", "accessRights": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tyggwp7656", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Environmental cues that potentially indicate the season can govern whether eggs enter a stage of diapause mid-way through development or skip this diapause and instead undergo direct development. We report, based on construction of a supermatrix phylogenetic tree of the order Cyprinodontiformes and a battery of comparative analyses, that the ability to produce diapause eggs evolved independently at least six times within African and South American killifish. We then show in species representative of these lineages that embryos entering diapause display significant reduction in development of the cranial region and circulatory system relative to direct-developing embryos. This divergence along alternative developmental pathways begins mid-way through development, well before diapause is entered, during a period of purported maximum developmental constraint (the phylotypic period). Finally, we show that entering diapause is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in metabolic rate and concomitant increase in long-term embryo survival. Morphological divergence during the phylotypic period thus allows embryos undergoing diapause to conserve energy by shunting resources away from energetically costly organs thereby increasing survival chances in an environment that necessitates remaining dormant, buried in the soil and surrounded by an eggshell for much of the year. Our results indicate that adaptation to seasonal aquatic environments in annual killifish imposes strong selection during the embryo stage leading to marked diversification during this otherwise conserved period of vertebrate development.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.hj68b", "publicationDate": "2014-12-30", "dateAvailable": "2014-12-30", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hj68b", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, the analysis of trajectories for relevant but rare events, such as a jump of the diffusing mobile ion, is still rather cumbersome, requiring prior knowledge of the diffusive process in order to get meaningful results. In this work we present a novel approach to detect the relevant events in a diffusive system without assuming prior information regarding the underlying process. We start from a projection of the atomic coordinates into a landmark basis to identify the dominant features in a mobile ion's environment. Subsequent clustering in landmark space enables a discretization of any trajectory into a sequence of distinct states. As a final step, the use of the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptor allows distinguishing between different environments in a straightforward way. We apply this algorithm to ten Li-ionic systems and conduct in-depth analyses of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12, tetragonal Li10GeP2S12, and the \u03b2-eucryptite LiAlSiO4.

These elements play a key role in microbial communities as vectors of horizontal gene transfer but can also be important sources of selection for their bacterial hosts. In natural communities, bacteria are likely to encounter multiple MGEs simultaneously and conflicting selection among MGEs could alter the bacterial evolutionary response to each MGE. Here, we test the effect of interactions with multiple MGEs on bacterial molecular evolution in the tripartite interaction between the bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, the lytic bacteriophage, SBW25\u03c62, and conjugative plasmid, pQBR103, using genome sequencing of experimentally evolved bacteria. We show that individually, both plasmids and phages impose selection leading to bacterial evolutionary responses that are distinct from bacterial populations evolving without MGEs, but that together, plasmids and phages impose conflicting selection on bacteria, constraining the evolutionary responses observed in pairwise interactions. Our findings highlight the likely difficulties of predicting evolutionary responses to multiple selective pressures from the observed evolutionary responses to each selective pressure alone. Understanding evolution in complex microbial communities comprising many species and MGEs will require that we go beyond studies of pairwise interactions.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.3hk0v", "publicationDate": "2017-02-27", "dateAvailable": "2017-02-27", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3hk0v", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In general, PCLs consist of a ligand of the target receptor covalently linked to an azobenzene, which can be reversibly switched between two configurations upon light illumination. Gluazo, as a PCL that targets excitatory amino acid receptors, in its dark-adapted trans iso-form was characterized to be a partial agonist of the kainate glutamate receptor GluK2. Application of UV light leads to the formation of the cis form, with remarkedly reduced affinity towards GluK2. The mechanism of the change of ligand affinity induced by the photoisomerization was unresolved. The presented computational study explains how the isomerization of such a PCL affects the structural changes in the target receptor that lead to its activation.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.7r71q", "publicationDate": "2015-09-03", "dateAvailable": "2015-09-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7r71q", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gs\u03b1. The results show that both ATP and Gs\u03b1 binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gs\u03b1 notably help to explain how Gs\u03b1 binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release.

This progress has been brought about by improvements in methods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the electronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate approximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use the Born\u2013Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy surface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify stable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions and phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the bottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or sampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and empirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new version of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible framework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using interatomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While the original version of the code (Ceriotti et al., 2014) was developed with a focus on path integral molecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes several new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of algorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force engine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that evaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.", "doi": "10.17632/x792grbm9g.1", "publicationDate": "2018-11-22", "dateAvailable": "2018-11-22", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/x792grbm9g", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Here, we investigated the repeated adaptation of the neotropical fish Poecilia mexicana to habitats containing toxic hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and compared two population pairs of sulphide-adapted and ancestral fish by sequencing population pools of &gt;200 individuals (Pool-Seq). We inferred the evolutionary processes shaping divergence and tested the hypothesis of increase of parallelism from SNPs to molecular pathways. Coalescence analyses showed that the divergence occurred in the face of substantial bidirectional gene flow. Population divergence involved many short, widely dispersed regions across the genome. Analyses of allele frequency spectra suggest that differentiation at most loci was driven by divergent selection, followed by a selection-mediated reduction of gene flow. Reconstructing allelic state changes suggested that selection acted mainly upon de novo mutations in the sulphide-adapted populations. Using a corrected Jaccard index to quantify parallel evolution, we found a negligible proportion of statistically significant parallel evolution of Jcorr = 0.0032 at the level of SNPs, divergent genome regions (Jcorr = 0.0061) and genes therein (Jcorr = 0.0091). At the level of metabolic pathways, the overlap was Jcorr = 0.2545, indicating increasing parallelism with increasing level of biological integration. The majority of pathways contained positively selected genes in both sulphide populations. Hence, adaptation to sulphidic habitats necessitated adjustments throughout the genome. The largely unique evolutionary trajectories may be explained by a high proportion of de novo mutations driving the divergence. Our findings favour Gould's view that evolution is often the unrepeatable result of stochastic events with highly contingent effects.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.ts351", "publicationDate": "2015-09-25", "dateAvailable": "2015-09-25", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ts351", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Nonetheless, it is interesting to ask whether an evolving population's mean fitness can increase indefinitely, and potentially without any limit, even in a constant environment. A recent study showed that fitness trajectories of Escherichia coli populations over 50 000 generations were better described by a power-law model than by a hyperbolic model. According to the power-law model, the rate of fitness gain declines over time but fitness has no upper limit, whereas the hyperbolic model implies a hard limit. Here, we examine whether the previously estimated power-law model predicts the fitness trajectory for an additional 10 000 generations. To that end, we conducted more than 1100 new competitive fitness assays. Consistent with the previous study, the power-law model fits the new data better than the hyperbolic model. We also analysed the variability in fitness among populations, finding subtle, but significant, heterogeneity in mean fitness. Some, but not all, of this variation reflects differences in mutation rate that evolved over time. Taken together, our results imply that both adaptation and divergence can continue indefinitely\u2014or at least for a long time\u2014even in a constant environment.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.gd3dq", "publicationDate": "2015-11-18", "dateAvailable": "2015-11-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gd3dq", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, current phylogenetic approaches for obtaining such estimates have limitations, such as providing unrealistic diversity estimates at the origin of the group. Here we develop a robust probabilistic approach for estimating Diversity-Through-Time (DTT) curves and uncertainty around these estimates from phylogenetic data. We show with simulations that under various realistic scenarios of diversification, this approach performs better than previously proposed approaches. We also characterize the effect of tree size and undersampling on the performance of the approach. We apply our method to understand patterns of species diversity in anurans (frogs and toads). We find that Archaeobatrachia -- a species-poor group of old frog clades often found in temperate regions -- formerly had much higher diversity and net diversification rate, but the group declined in diversity as younger, nested clades diversified. This diversity decline seems to be linked to a decline in speciation rate rather than an increase in extinction rate. Our approach, implemented in the R package RPANDA, should be useful for evolutionary biologists interested in understanding how past diversity dynamics have shaped present-day diversity. It could also be useful in other contexts, such as for analyzing clade-clade competitive effects or the effect of species richness on phenotypic divergence.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.4nr63", "publicationDate": "2019-08-28", "dateAvailable": "2019-08-28", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4nr63", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The famed notion that \u2018ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\u2019 has been largely discredited, but there remains an expectation that closely related organisms undergo similar morphological transformations throughout ontogeny. To test this assumption, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometric methods to characterize the cranial morphology of 10 extant crocodylian species and construct allometric trajectories that model the post-natal ontogenetic shape changes. Using time-calibrated molecular and morphological trees, we employed a suite of comparative phylogenetic methods to assess the extent of phylogenetic signal in these trajectories. All analyses largely demonstrated a lack of significant phylogenetic signal, indicating that ontogenetic shape changes contain little phylogenetic information. Notably, some Mantel tests yielded marginally significant results when analysed with the morphological tree, which suggest that the underlying signal in these trajectories is correlated with similarities in the adult cranial morphology. However, despite these instances, all other analyses, including more powerful tests for phylogenetic signal, recovered statistical and visual evidence against the assumption that similarities in ontogenetic shape changes are commensurate with phylogenetic relatedness and thus bring into question the efficacy of using allometric trajectories for phylogenetic inference.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.14fn1", "publicationDate": "2014-03-25", "dateAvailable": "2014-03-25", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.14fn1", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory.

Here we reconstruct the diversity trajectory in noctilionoid bats of the Greater Antilles by applying a dynamic model of colonisation, extinction and speciation to phylogenetic and paleontological data. We show species richness asymptotes to an equilibrium value, demonstrating natural equilibrium dynamics across an entire community. However, recent extinctions have wiped out nearly a third of island lineages, dragging diversity away from equilibrium.

The characteristics of these laser-based flow manipulations suggest that they may augment, or be superior to, such traditional electro-mechanical methods as ionic flow control, shock tubes, and small scale wind tunnels.  In this study, methodology was developed for investigating laser flow manipulation techniques, and testing their feasibility for a number of aerospace, basic physics, and micro technology applications.  Theories for laser-atom and laser-molecule interactions have been under development since the advent of laser technology.  The theories have yet to be adequately integrated into kinetic flow solvers.  Realizing this integration would greatly enhance the scaling of laser-species interactions beyond the realm of ultra-cold atomic physics.  This goal was realized in the present study.  A representative numerical investigation, of laser-based neutral atomic and molecular flow manipulations, was conducted using near-resonant and non-resonant laser fields.  To simulate the laser interactions over a range of laser and flow conditions, the following tools were employed: a custom collisionless gas particle trajectory code and a specifically modified version of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo statistical kinetic solver known as SMILE.  In addition to the numerical investigations, a validating experiment was conducted.  The experimental results showed good agreement with the numerical simulations when experimental parameters, such as finite laser line width, were taken into account.  Several areas of interest were addressed: laser induced neutral flow steering, collimation, direct flow acceleration, and neutral gas heating.  Near-resonant continuous wave laser, and non-resonant pulsed laser, interactions with cesium and nitrogen were simulated.; These simulations showed trends and some limitations associated with these interactions, used for flow steering and collimation.  The use of one of these interactions, the induced dipole force, was extended beyond a single Gaussian laser field.  The interference patterns associated with counter-propagating laser fields, or \u201coptical lattices,\u201d were shown to be capable of both direct species acceleration and gas heating.  This study resulted in predictions for a continuous, resonant laser-cesium flow with accelerations of 106 m/s2.  For this circumstance, a future straightforward proof of principle experiment has been identified.  To demonstrate non-resonant gas heating, a series of pulsed optical lattices were simulated interacting with neutral non-polar species.  An optimum time between pulses was identified as a function of the collisional relaxation time.  Using the optimum time between pulses, molecular nitrogen simulations showed an increase in gas temperature from 300 K to 2470 K at 1 atm, for 50 successive optical lattice pulses.  A second proof of principle experiment was identified for future investigation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3207", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3207", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

While theory predicts biodiversity on islands tends towards equilibrium, the recent extinction of large proportions of island biotas complicates testing this model. The well-preserved subfossil record of Caribbean bats provides a rare opportunity to model diversity dynamics in an insular community. Here we reconstruct the diversity trajectory in noctilionoid bats of the Greater Antilles by applying a dynamic model of colonisation, extinction and speciation to phylogenetic and paleontological data. We show species richness asymptotes to an equilibrium value, demonstrating natural equilibrium dynamics across an entire community. However, recent extinctions have wiped out nearly a third of island lineages, dragging diversity away from equilibrium. Using a metric to measure island biodiversity loss, we estimate it will take at least eight million years to regain pre-human diversity levels. Our integrative approach reveals how anthropogenic extinctions can drastically alter the natural trajectory of biological communities.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.9mk20", "publicationDate": "2017-01-12", "dateAvailable": "2017-01-12", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9mk20", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In polyploids, the patterns of purifying selection and adaptive substitutions may be affected by masking owing to duplicated genes or homeologs as well as effective population size. Here, we resequence 25 accessions of the allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica, which is derived from the diploid species A. halleri and A. lyrata. We observe a reduction in purifying selection compared with the parental species. Interestingly, proportions of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions are significantly positive in contrast to most plant species. A recurrent pattern observed in both frequency and divergence\u2013diversity neutrality tests is that the genome-wide distributions of both subgenomes are similar, but the correlation between homeologous pairs is low.

Historically, this enzyme has been an extremely important model system for understanding the fundamentals of biological catalysis. TIM is activated through an energetically demanding conformational change, which helps position the side chains of two key hydrophobic residues (I170 and L230), over the carboxylate side chain of E165. This is critical both for creating a hydrophobic pocket for the catalytic base and for maintaining correct active site architecture. Truncation of these residues to alanine causes significant falloffs in TIM\u2019s catalytic activity, but experiments have failed to provide a full description of the action of this clamp in promoting substrate deprotonation. We perform here detailed empirical valence bond calculations of the TIM-catalyzed deprotonation of DHAP and GAP by both wild-type TIM and its I170A, L230A, and I170A/L230A mutants, obtaining exceptional quantitative agreement with experiment. Our calculations provide a linear free energy relationship, with slope 0.8, between the activation barriers and Gibbs free energies for these TIM-catalyzed reactions. We conclude that these clamping side chains minimize the Gibbs free energy for substrate deprotonation, and that the effects on reaction driving force are largely expressed at the transition state for proton transfer. Our combined analysis of previous experimental and current computational results allows us to provide an overview of the breakdown of ground-state and transition state effects in enzyme catalysis in unprecedented detail, providing a molecular description of the operation of a hydrophobic clamp in triosephosphate isomerase.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.f9v80", "publicationDate": "2017-07-07", "dateAvailable": "2017-07-07", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f9v80", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We used a combination of mtDNA control region sequences and microsatellite genotypes to infer population structure and levels of genetic diversity. Our results from both molecular marker types were congruent and revealed strong levels of structuring (microsatellites FST = 0.385, p &lt; .001; mtDNA FST =  0.183, p &lt; .001; \u03a6ST = 0.385, p &lt; .001) and much lower genetic diversity in the coastal than the offshore ecotype, supporting patterns found in previous studies elsewhere. Despite the opportunity for gene flow in potential \u201ccontact zones\u201d, we found minimal current and historical connectivity between ecotypes, suggesting they are following discrete evolutionary trajectories. Based on our molecular findings, which seem to be consistent with morphological differentiations recently described for bottlenose dolphins in our study area, we recommend recognizing the offshore bottlenose dolphin ecotype as an additional Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) in the SWA. Implications of these results for the conservation of bottlenose dolphins in SWA are also discussed.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.t130r", "publicationDate": "2017-10-03", "dateAvailable": "2017-10-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t130r", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

These evolutionary shifts depend upon modifications of the developmental processes which direct growth and morphogenesis. Here we examine the evolution of cranial ontogenetic trajectories to shed light on the mechanisms underlying convergent snout evolution. We use geometric morphometrics to quantify skeletogenesis in an evolutionary context and reconstruct ancestral patterns of ontogenetic allometry to understand the developmental drivers of craniofacial diversity within Crocodylia. Our analyses uncovered a conserved embryonic region of morphospace (CER) shared by all non-gavialid crocodylians regardless of their eventual adult ecomorph. This observation suggests the presence of conserved developmental processes during early development (before Ferguson stage 20) across most of Crocodylia. Ancestral state reconstruction of ontogenetic trajectories revealed heterochrony, developmental constraint, and developmental systems drift have all played essential roles in the evolution of ecomorphs. Based on these observations, we conclude that two separate, but interconnected, developmental programs controlling craniofacial morphogenesis and growth enabled the evolutionary plasticity of skull shape in crocodylians.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.6cv82g1", "publicationDate": "2019-01-29", "dateAvailable": "2019-01-29", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6cv82g1", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

When a protein experiences a changed environment, it is under strong selection to find a peak in the new fitness landscape. It has been shown that strong selection increases epistatic interactions as well as the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but little is known about how the epistatic interactions change under selection in the long-term evolution of a protein. Here we analyze the evolution of epistasis in the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using protease sequences collected for almost a decade from both treated and untreated patients, to understand how epistasis changes and how those changes impact the long-term evolvability of a protein. We use an information-theoretic proxy for epistasis that quantifies the co-variation between sites, and show that positive information is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition that detects epistasis in most cases. We analyze the \u201cfossils\u201d of the evolutionary trajectories of the protein contained in the sequence data, and show that epistasis continues to enrich under strong selection, but not for proteins whose environment is unchanged. The increase in epistasis compensates for the information loss due to sequence variability brought about by treatment, and facilitates adaptation in the increasingly rugged fitness landscape of treatment. While epistasis is thought to enhance evolvability via valley-crossing early-on in adaptation, it can hinder adaptation later when the landscape has turned rugged. However, we find no evidence that the HIV-1 protease has reached its potential for evolution after 9 years of adapting to a drug environment that itself is constantly changing. We suggest that the mechanism of encoding new information into pairwise interactions is central to protein evolution not just in HIV-1 protease, but for any protein adapting to a changing environment.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.q66s5", "publicationDate": "2016-04-15", "dateAvailable": "2016-04-15", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q66s5", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Here, we performed comparative directed evolution of four orthologous metallo-\u03b2-lactamases toward a new function and found that different starting genotypes evolved to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Despite a low initial fitness, one ortholog reached a significantly higher fitness plateau than its counterparts, via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity.

In Arabidopsis thaliana leaf trichomes provide a key defense against insect herbivory; however, trichome production incurs a fitness cost in the absence of herbivory. Previous work on A. thaliana has shown an increase in trichome density in response to leaf damage, suggesting a mechanism by which the cost associated with constitutively high trichome density might be mitigated; however, the genetic basis of trichome density induction has not been studied. Results: Here, we describe the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for constitutive and damage induced trichome density in two new recombinant inbred line populations of A. thaliana; mapping for constitutive and induced trichome density also allowed for the investigation of damage response (plasticity) QTL.  Both novel and previously identified QTL for constitutive trichome density and the first QTL for induced trichome density and response are identified. Interestingly, two of the four parental accessions and multiple RILs in each population exhibited lower trichome density following leaf damage, a response not previously described in A. thaliana. Importantly, a single QTL was mapped for the response phenotype and allelic variation at this locus appears to determine response trajectory in RILs. The data also show that epistatic interactions are a significant component of the genetic architecture of trichome density. Conclusions: Together, our results provide further insights into the genetic architecture of constitutive trichome density and new insights into induced trichome density in A. thaliana specifically and to our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of natural variation generally.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.2bs8g", "publicationDate": "2014-05-09", "dateAvailable": "2014-05-09", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2bs8g", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Unequal distribution of species among lineages suggests that diversification, the process which ultimately determines species-richness, acted differentially through angiosperm evolution.\nMethods: We investigate how angiosperms became megadiverse by identifying the phylogenetic and temporal placement of exceptional radiations, by combining the most densely fossil-calibrated molecular clock phylogeny with a Bayesian model that identifies diversification shifts among evolutionary lineages and through time. We evaluate the effect of the prior number of expected shifts in the phylogenetic tree.\nKey results: Major diversification increases took place over 100 Ma, from the Early Cretaceous to the end of the Paleogene, and are distributed across the angiosperm phylogeny. Angiosperm long-term diversification trajectory shows moderate rate variation, but is underlain by increasing speciation and extinction, and results from temporally overlapping, independent radiations and depletions in component lineages.\nConclusions: The identified deep time diversification shifts are clues to identify ultimate drivers of angiosperm megadiversity, which probably involve multivariate interactions among intrinsic traits and extrinsic forces. An enhanced understanding of angiosperm diversification will involve a more precise phylogenetic location of diversification shifts, and integration of fossil information.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.4f80hb4", "publicationDate": "2018-11-01", "dateAvailable": "2018-11-01", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4f80hb4", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, current approaches do not yet explicitly account for a key aspect of habitat use, namely the sequential variation in the use of different habitat features.  To overcome this limitation, we propose a tree-based approach that makes use of sequence analysis methods, derived from molecular biology, to explore and identify ecologically relevant sequential patterns in habitat use by animals. We applied this approach to ecological data consisting of simulated and real trajectories from a roe deer population (Capreolus capreolus), expressed as ordered sequences of habitat use.  We show that our approach effectively captured spatio-temporal patterns of sequential habitat use by roe deer. In our case study, individual sequences were clustered according to the sequential use of the elevation gradient (first order) and of open/closed habitats (second order). We provided evidence for several behavioural processes, such as migration and daily alternating habitat use. Some unexpected patterns, such as homogeneous sequences of use of open habitat, could also be identified.  Our findings advocate the importance of dealing with the sequential nature of movement data. Approaches based on sequence analysis methods are particularly useful and effective since they allow exploring temporal patterns of habitat use in a synthetic and visually captive manner. The proposed approach represents a useful and effective way to classify individual movement behaviour across populations and species. Ultimately, this method can be applied to explore the temporal scale of ecological processes based on movement.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.h4f7p", "publicationDate": "2015-08-11", "dateAvailable": "2015-08-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h4f7p", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Their origin cannot be understood by a morphological comparison to gymnosperms, their closest relatives, which develop separate male or female cones. Despite these morphological differences, gymnosperms and angiosperms possess a similar genetic toolbox consisting of phylogenetically related MADS-domain proteins. Using ancestral MADS-domain protein reconstruction, we trace the evolution of organ identity quartets along the stem lineage of crown angiosperms. We provide evidence that current floral quartets specifying male organ identity, which consist of four types of subunits, evolved from ancestral complexes of two types of subunits through gene duplication and integration of SEPALLATA proteins just before the origin of flowering plants.

Using two murine models of cartilage undergrowth that target two very different mechanisms, we show that strong reduction in cartilage growth produces a short, wide, and more flexed cranial base. This in turn produces a short, wide face in both models. Cranial base and face are already correlated early in ontogeny, and the relationship between these modules gains structure through postnatal growth and development. These results provide further evidence that there exist physical interactions between developing parts of the phenotype that produce variation at a distance from the actual locus upon which a particular selective pressure is acting. Phenotypic changes observed over the course of evolution may not all require adaptationist explanations; rather, it is likely that a substantial portion of observed phenotypic variation over the history of a clade is not directly adaptive but rather a secondary consequence of some local response to selection.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.35vf4", "publicationDate": "2015-05-28", "dateAvailable": "2015-05-28", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.35vf4", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We leveraged a natural experiment to investigate evidence of inbreeding depression and genetic rescue in a remnant population of subalpine-specialized Sierra Nevada red foxes (Vulpes vulpes necator) using noninvasive genetic monitoring during 2010\u20132017. Only 7 individuals were detected in the first 2 years. These individuals assigned genetically to the historical population and exhibited genetic hallmarks of inbreeding and no evidence of reproduction. Two years into the study, we detected 2 first-generation immigrant males from a recently expanding population of red foxes in the Great Basin Desert. Through annual resampling of individuals (634 red fox DNA samples, 41 individuals) and molecular reconstruction of pedigrees, we documented 1\u20133 litters/yr for 5 years, all descended directly or indirectly from matings involving immigrant foxes. The observed heterozygosity and allelic richness of the population nearly doubled in 2 years. Abundance increased, indicative of a rapidly expanding population. Throughout the study, adult survival was high. Restoration of gene flow apparently improved the demographic trajectory of this population in the short term. Whether these benefits continue in the longer-term could depend on numerous factors, such as maintenance of any locally adapted alleles. This study highlights the value of noninvasive genetic monitoring to assess rapidly shifting conditions in small populations. Uncertainties about the longer-term trajectory of this population underscore the need to continue monitoring and to research potential for both negative and positive aspects of continued genetic infusion.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.5k8q374", "publicationDate": "2019-04-11", "dateAvailable": "2019-04-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5k8q374", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, how genomes diverge over time after geographic isolation has halted gene flow has remained unclear. We examine genome-wide divergence of putatively single-copy orthologous genes (POGs) from transcriptomes in 20 allopatric species/variety pairs from diverse angiosperm clades. Sixteen of these pairs reflect the well-known eastern Asia \u2013 eastern North America floristic disjunction; these species have been isolated for different lengths of time, from the Miocene to Pleistocene. Results: Molecular evolutionary analyses revealed that &gt;90% of the genes examined are under purifying selection and &lt;10% are under positive selection, and this pattern was observed for all taxon pairs, despite differences in divergence time. The divergence level at synonymous sites shared by most POGs in each taxon pair predicts the divergence time between the species/varieties. Divergence time estimates were positively correlated with abundance of genes under moderate purifying selection, but negatively correlated with abundance of genes under strong purifying selection. We identified 200 genes under strong positive selection across the species pairs, with 14 shared by 10-15 pairs and one shared by all taxon pairs. An additional 15 loci annotated to biological processes responding to various stimuli were present in 1-3 pairs.Conclusions: Our results suggest a common \u201cmost genes conserved\u2013few genes adaptive\u201d genomic architecture for the taxon pairs, which may be a key for maintaining a balance between the ability to conserve ancestral functions and the ability to evolve new features beneficial for new adaptations.

While the identity of the sensory protein has remained speculative, cryptochrome 4 has recently been identified as the most auspicious candidate. Here, we re-port on all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations addressing the structural reorganisations that accompany the photoreduction of the flavin cofactor in a model of the European robin crypto-chrome 4 (ErCry4). Extensive MD simulations reveal that the photo-activation of ErCry4 induces large-scale conformational changes on short (hundreds of nanoseconds) timescales. Specifically, the photo-reduction is accompanied with the release of the C-terminal tail, structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the FAD-binding site, and the noteworthy formation of an \u03b1-helical segment at the N-terminal part. Some of these rearrangements appear to expose potential phosphorylation sites. We describe the conformational dynamics of the protein using a graph-based approach that is informed by the adjacency of residues and the correlation of their local motions. This approach reveals densely coupled reorganisation communities, which facilitate an efficient signal transduction due to a high density of hubs. These communities are interconnected by a small number of highly important residues characterized by high betweenness centrality. The network approach clearly identifies the sites restructuring upon photo-activation, which appear as protrusions or delicate bridges in the reorganisation network. We also find that, unlike in the homologous cryptochrome from D. melanogaster, the release of the C-terminal domain does not appear to be correlated with the transposition of a histidine residue close to the FAD cofactor.,Exemplary NAMD input, parameter and output files for the radical pair sate (RPD) of cryptochrome 4 from E. rebecula (European robin), including a 100 ns MD trajectory of the protein (solvent removed from the original output).,The article associated with this dataset is located in ORE at: http://hdl.handle.net/10871/35086,", "doi": "10.24378/exe.363", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": "2018-09-28", "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.24378%2Fexe.363", "method": null, "source": "bl.exeter", "type_cont": null},

However, whether these dispersive widespread taxa constitute long-term panmictic populations across their species ranges remains unknown. Conventional phylogeographical inferences frequently fail to distinguish between long-term panmixia and metapopulations connected by gene flow. Moreover, marine organisms have notoriously large effective population sizes that confound population structure detection. Therefore, at what spatial scale marine populations experience independent evolutionary trajectories and ultimately species divergence is still unclear. Here, we present a phylogeographical study of a cosmopolitan Indo-Pacific coral reef fish Naso hexacanthus and its sister species Naso caesius, using two mtDNA and two nDNA markers. The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to test for broad-scale panmixia in N. hexacanthus by fitting the data to various phylogeographical models within a Bayesian statistical framework, and second, to explore patterns of genetic divergence between the two broadly sympatric species. We report that N. hexacanthus shows little population structure across the Indo-Pacific and a range-wide, long-term panmictic population model best fit the data. Hence, this species presently comprises a single evolutionary unit across much of the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. Naso hexacanthus and N. caesius were not reciprocally monophyletic in the mtDNA markers but showed varying degrees of population level divergence in the two nuclear introns.

Ten genes have documented roles in nervous system development and energy metabolism, others are novel candidates in brain development. Sixteen transcripts showed similar patterns of expression, characterized by decreasing expression during childhood. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that the regulatory regions of three genes have evidence of adaptive evolution in recent human evolution.\nConclusions:\nThese findings provide evidence that a subset of genes expressed in the human cerebral cortex broadly mirror developmental patterns of cortical glucose consumption.  Whether there is a causal relationship between gene expression and glucose utilization remains to be determined.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.fj8dm", "publicationDate": "2013-04-08", "dateAvailable": "2013-04-08", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fj8dm", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We present herein a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution under progressively relaxed functional constraints during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that relaxed purifying selection in all plastid genes is linked to obligate parasitism, characterized by the parasite\u2019s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Evolutionary rates and selection pressure coevolve with macrostructural and microstructural changes, the extent of functional reduction, and the establishment of the obligate parasitic lifestyle. Inferred bursts of gene losses coincide with periods of relaxed selection, which are followed by phases of intensified selection and rate deceleration in the retained functional complexes. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.t2m75", "publicationDate": "2016-07-27", "dateAvailable": "2016-07-27", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t2m75", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

These histograms represent 2-point spatial correlation functions and are routinely calculated from simulations of soft and condensed matter, where they are referred to as radial distribution functions, and in the analysis of the spatial distributions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Although conceptually simple, the calculation of radial distribution functions via distance binning requires the evaluation of O(N^2) particle-pair distances where N is the number of particles under consideration. CADISHI provides fast parallel implementations of the distance histogram algorithm for the CPU and the GPU, written in templated C++ and CUDA. Orthorhombic and general triclinic periodic boxes are supported, in addition to the non-periodic case. The CPU kernels feature cache-blocking, vectorization and thread-parallelization to obtain high performance. The GPU kernels are tuned to exploit the memory and processor features of current GPUs, demonstrating histogramming rates of up to a factor 40 higher than on a high-end multi-core CPU. To enable high-throughput analyses of molecular dynamics trajectories, the compute kernels are driven by the Python-based CADISHI engine. It implements a producer\u2013consumer data processing pattern and thereby enables the complete utilization of all the CPU and GPU resources available on a specific computer, independent of special libraries such as MPI, covering commodity systems up to high-end HPC nodes. Data input and output are performed efficiently via HDF5. In addition, our CPU and GPU kernels can be compiled into a standard C library and used with any application, independent from the CADISHI engine or Python.

We find that aging is associated with increased metabolite diversity and low-abundance molecules, suggesting they include cumulative damage. Remarkably, the number of detected compounds leveled-off in late-life, and this pattern associated with survivorship.  Fourteen-percent of metabolites showed age-associated changes, which decelerated in late-life and long-lived flies.  In contrast, known metabolites changed in abundance similarly to nontargeted metabolites and transcripts, but did not increase in diversity.

We discuss the parallels between the eigenvectors (principal components) identified by principal components analysis (PCA) and the simple basis (SB) vectors identified by SBA. We apply these methods to estimated G matrices obtained from 10 studies of thermal performance curves and growth curves. Our results suggest that variation in overall size across all ages represented most of the genetic variance in growth curves. In contrast, variation in overall performance across all temperatures represented less than one-third of the genetic variance in thermal performance curves in all cases, and genetic trade-offs between performance at higher versus lower temperatures were often important. The analyses also identify potential genetic constraints on patterns of early and later growth in growth curves.

The code makes use of platform-independent tools and can be readily transferred to any computer platform which can run python. It is straightforward to incorporate the code into the LAMMPS software as well as into other molecular simulation programs. In the computational part of this work, we evaluate the intramolecular entropy of atactic polystyrene and polyethylene melts in an all atom as well as in a coarse grained (CG) resolution at five temperatures between 400 and 450 K. For both polymers, coarse graining with its reduced system degrees of freedom and its softened bonded radial potential, causes a strong reduction of the entropy. However, the averaged entropy per degree of freedom in the CG case exceeds the one under atomistic resolution. Also the temperature dependence of the intramolecular entropy becomes weaker in the transition from an atomistic to a coarse grained description. The larger entropy of polyethylene in comparison to polystyrene under both resolutions is a consequence of its longer chain length. To simplify a comparison of the two polymers in the two considered resolutions, we analyze the total intramolecular entropy as well as its temperature gradient via a scaling of both quantities by the number of degrees of freedom. In the two studied systems and for both levels of resolution, a linear dependence of the intramolecular entropy on the temperature is identified.", "doi": "10.17632/xn3ccj6kym.1", "publicationDate": "2018-08-22", "dateAvailable": "2018-08-22", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xn3ccj6kym", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic information that often cannot be detected by experiment alone and also serve as a predictive tool to stimulate new research. However, sophisticated modeling of ultrafast processes, especially those involving excited states, is intellectually challenging and computationally demanding. The work presented here provides several diverse examples of challenging gas phase and condensed phase ultrafast photoinduced processes. For each system, we offer a detailed account of the computational modeling scheme employed for an accurate description of the chemical and physical properties of interest. At the same time, we highlight the limitations of the particular dynamics methods used. \u2767 In Chapter 1, we start with an overview of the adiabatic and the non-adiabatic dynamics. This is followed by a description of the primary non-adiabatic dynamics methods, the Ehrenfest dynamics and the Fewest Switches Surface Hopping method. We also describe the major limitations of the two approaches, especially the neglect of decoherence effects among others. \u2767 This is followed by an example of the application of adiabatic molecular dynamics in Chapter 2 to study the atomistic origin of room temperature coherence between the light-hole and heavy-hole excitations in two-dimensional CdSe and CdSe/CdZnS core/shell nanoplatelets, synthesized and studied recently by optical spectroscopy. The molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to mimic closely the experimental systems and measurements, and to elucidate the role of defects that are inevitably present in experiment. Chapter 3 provides another application of quantum-classical molecular dynamics to study the conversion of He(2\u00b3S) to He\u2082(a\u2083\u03a3\u1d64\u207a) in large helium nanodroplets. He \u20f0\u2082 is a likely participant in the production of He\u2084\u207a on surfaces of large helium droplets which shows an anomalously intense peak in mass spectra of large helium droplets. Ab initio molecular dynamics with highly accurate and robust equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theory, showed rapid and efficient conversion of He \u20f0  to He \u20f0\u2082 in systems composed of small numbers of Helium atoms. \u2767 The Born-Oppenheimer dynamics is followed by the non-adiabatic dynamics with electronic transitions in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 analyzes the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm and brings attention to one of its limitations, the trivial crossing problem. It provides a comparison of the standard fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm with the Min-Cost adiabatic state identity tracking algorithm, which treats the trivial crossing problem of FSSH. The performance of the two methods is investigated for the internal conversion and energy transfer dynamics of a weakly coupled spiro-linked polyfluorene (spirobifluorene) system. The results reveal that FSSH fails to identify trivial crossings, therefore, the system remains on the upper adiabatic surface at such crossings and reaches the lowest excited state only via non-adiabatic transitions resulting in a longer relaxation time-scale as compared to the Min-Cost method. \u2767 Chapter 5 addresses the other primary mixed quantum classical dynamics method, the Ehrenfest method. Ehrenfest method does not produce the Boltzmann equilibrium populations of the quantum states at a finite temperature. Additionally, both the Ehrenfest MD and the FSSH techniques are fully quantum coherent, they do not account for decoherence. In this chapter, we present a semiclassical approach for non-adiabatic molecular dynamics based on the Ehrenfest method with corrections for decoherence effects and detailed balance. The decoherence effects are described via a coherence penalty functional that drives dynamics away from regions in Hilbert space characterized by large values of coherences. Detailed balance is described by modification of the off-diagonal matrix elements with a quantum correction factor used in semiclassical approximations to quantum time-correlation functions. Both decoherence and detailed balance corrections introduce non-linear terms to the Schrodinger equation. At the same time, the simplicity of the Ehrenfest method, which involves fully deterministic dynamics and requires a single trajectory for each initial condition, is preserved. In contrast, surface hopping techniques contain stochastic elements and require averaging over multiple realizations of stochastic process for each initial condition. The method is applied to a hybrid nanoscale system consisting of a fluorophore molecule and an STM tip studied experimentally. By investigating current-induced charge injection, cooling, and recombination, we demonstrate that the Ehrenfest-decoherence-detailed-balance (Ehrenfest-DDB) method produces timescales that are similar to those obtained with the decoherence induced surface hopping (DISH), which is a popular nonadiabatic molecular dynamics technique used with many condensed matter and nanoscale systems. The Ehrenfest-DDB technique provides efficient means to study quantum dynamics in large, realistic systems. \u2767 Finally, in chapter 6, we outline future directions and discuss further investigations of the developed computational scheme to establish the range of problems it can be applied to with useful accuracy.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-121057", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-121057", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

However, the evolutionary pressures that give rise to delineated germ and somatic cells remain unclear. Here we propose a hypothesis that the mutagenic consequences associated with performing metabolic work favor such differentiation. We present evidence in support of this hypothesis gathered using a computational form of experimental evolution. Our digital organisms begin each experiment as undifferentiated multicellular individuals, and can evolve computational functions that improve their rate of reproduction. When such functions are associated with moderate mutagenic effects, we observe the evolution of reproductive division of labor within our multicellular organisms. Specifically, a fraction of the cells remove themselves from consideration as propagules for multicellular offspring, while simultaneously performing a disproportionately large amount of mutagenic work, and are thus classified as soma. As a consequence, other cells are able to take on the role of germ, remaining quiescent and thus protecting their genetic information. We analyze the lineages of multicellular organisms that successfully differentiate and discover that they display unforeseen evolutionary trajectories: cells first exhibit developmental patterns that concentrate metabolic work into a subset of germ cells (which we call \u201cpseudo-somatic cells\u201d) and later evolve to eliminate the reproductive potential of these cells and thus convert them to actual soma. We also demonstrate that the evolution of somatic cells enables phenotypic strategies that are otherwise not easily accessible to undifferentiated organisms, though expression of these new phenotypic traits typically includes negative side effects such as aging.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.rt01f", "publicationDate": "2014-05-14", "dateAvailable": "2014-05-14", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rt01f", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Several lines of evidence attribute to PE and PE_PGRS genes critical roles in mycobacterial pathogenicity. To get more insight into the nature of these genes, we sought to address their evolutionary trajectories in the group of smooth tubercle bacilli (STB), the putative ancestor of the clonal MTBC. Methodology/Principal Findings: By focussing on six polymorphic STB PE/PE_PGRS genes, we demonstrate significant incongruence among single gene genealogies and detect strong signals of recombination using various approaches. Coalescent-based estimation of population recombination and mutation rates (\u03c1 and \u03b8, respectively) indicates that the two mechanisms are of roughly equal importance in generating diversity (\u03c1/\u03b8 = 1.457), a finding in a marked contrast to house keeping genes (HKG) whose evolution is chiefly brought about by mutation (\u03c1/\u03b8 = 0.012). In comparison to HKG, we found 15 times higher mean rate of nonsynonymous substitutions, with strong evidence of positive selection acting on PE_PGRS62 (dN/dS = 1.42), a gene that has previously been shown to be essential for mycobacterial survival in macrophages and granulomas. Imprint of positive selection operating on specific amino acid residues or along branches of PE_PGRS62 phylogenetic tree was further demonstrated using maximum likelihood- and covarion-based approaches, respectively. Strikingly, PE_PGR62 proved highly conserved in present-day MTBC strains. Conclusions/Significance: Overall the data indicate that, in STB, PE/PE_PGRS genes have undergone a strong diversification process that is speeded up by recombination, with evidence of positive selection. The finding that positive selection involved an essential PE_PGRS gene whose sequence appears to be driven to fixation in present-day MTBC strains lends further support to the critical role of PE/PE_PGRS genes in the evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.c8jg8", "publicationDate": "2013-06-04", "dateAvailable": "2013-06-04", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c8jg8", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Mesic tropical ecosystems were progressively restricted to the coasts and replaced by arid-adapted floral and faunal communities. Whilst the role of aridification has been investigated in a wide range of terrestrial lineages, the response of freshwater clades remains poorly investigated. To gain insights into the diversification processes underlying a freshwater radiation, we studied the evolutionary history of the Australasian predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Hydroporini (147 described species). We used an integrative approach including the latest methods in phylogenetics, divergence time estimation, ancestral character state reconstruction, and likelihood-based methods of diversification rate estimation. Phylogenies and dating analyses were reconstructed with molecular data from seven genes (mitochondrial and nuclear) for 117 species (plus 12 outgroups). Robust and well-resolved phylogenies indicate a late Oligocene origin of Australasian Hydroporini. Biogeographic analyses suggest an origin in the East Coast region of Australia, and a dynamic biogeographic scenario implying dispersal events. The group successfully colonized the tropical coastal regions carved by a rampant desertification, and also colonized groundwater ecosystems in Central Australia. Diversification rate analyses suggest that the ongoing aridification of Australia initiated in the Miocene contributed to a major wave of extinctions since the late Pliocene probably attributable to an increasing aridity, range contractions and seasonally disruptions resulting from Quaternary climatic changes. When comparing subterranean and epigean genera, our results show that contrasting mechanisms drove their diversification and therefore current diversity pattern. The Australasian Hydroporini radiation reflects a combination of processes that promoted both diversification, resulting from new ecological opportunities driven by initial aridification, and a subsequent loss of mesic adapted diversity due to increasing aridity.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.c5g23", "publicationDate": "2014-07-18", "dateAvailable": "2014-07-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c5g23", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Occurring approximately 480 MYA (Sanderson 2003; Kenrick et. al. 2012), the evolutionary transition of plants from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment was accompanied by several major developmental innovations. The freshwater charophyte ancestors of land plants have a haplobiontic life cycle with a single haploid multicellular stage, whereas land plants, which include the bryophytes (liverworts, hornworts, and mosses) and tracheophytes (also called vascular plants, namely, lycopods, ferns, and seed plants), exhibit a marked alternation of generations with a diplobiontic life-cycle with both haploid and diploid multicellular stages and where the embryo remains attached to, and is nourished by, the gametophyte (Haig 2008). The interjection of a multicellular diploid phase into the land plant life cycle was an important adaptation that enabled long-distance dispersal via mitotic spores where water-borne male gametes have restricted motility in dry terrestrial environments. Despite the similarity among land-plant life-cycles, they differ in one significant aspect: in the three bryophyte groups, the haploid gametophytic stage is the dominant vegetative stage, whereas in vascular plants the diploid sporophyte dominates. A common assumption, and one implied by the tradition of referring to bryophytes as \u201clower plants\u201d - in contrast to the \u201chigher plants\u201d, the tracheophytes - is that the bryophytes and their life-cycle are primitive (Kato and Akiyama 2005). However, without a strong phylogenetic hypothesis of land-plant relationships, it is not clear which (if either) of the gametophyte or sporophyte was the dominant ancestral vegetative state present in the earliest land plants (Renzaglia et al. 2007; Qiu et al. 2012). Early land plants have a relatively poor fossil record with few intermediate forms (Kenrick and Crane 1997; Wellman et al. 2003; Clarke et al. 2011), so most of the evidence for early land plant evolution has been based upon the patterns of morphological change that are implied by phylogenetic trees of relationships among extant land plant and algal groups. In this context, several recent studies based on large molecular data sets have converged upon a phylogenetic solution to land plant origins wherein tracheophytes are derived from bryophyte ancestors (Karol et al. 2001; Qiu et al. 2006; Gao et al. 2010; Karol et al. 2010; Chang and Graham 2011). In this hypothesis, the three bryophyte groups, namely liverworts, mosses, and hornworts, diverged sequentially and form a paraphyletic group with the hornworts sister to the tracheophytes. This phylogeny supports an intuitively elegant evolutionary trajectory whereby plants increased in morphological complexity from single-celled algae to seed plants via bryophyte intermediates (Karol et al. 2001; McCourt et al. 2004). Specifically, it implies that the gametophyte-dominant bryophyte life-cycle was ancestral among land plants and that the complex modular growth form of the vascular plant sporophyte evolved from the simplistic bryophyte sporophyte that consists only of a single growth module (Kato and Akiyama 2005; Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my and Caraglio 2007).", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.26qt6", "publicationDate": "2014-01-07", "dateAvailable": "2014-01-07", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.26qt6", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Furthermore, dysfunction of the serotonergic system has been implicated in a number of developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and schizophrenia. These conditions have been associated epidemiologically with adverse prenatal events, suggesting a link between maternal insults during pregnancy and altered trajectories of fetal neurodevelopment, which ultimately contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the exact impact and the mechanisms underlying the link between adverse gestational conditions and altered fetal neurodevelopment remain relatively poorly understood. The goal of this dissertation is to describe a potential mechanism linking maternal infection and inflammation during mid-to-late gestation with altered fetal neurodevelopment and the eventual onset of neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring. During my research, I discovered that maternal inflammation leads to altered placental tryptophan metabolism by inducing a transcriptional and translational cascade in the placenta, which in turn impacts fetal neurochemistry, neurodevelopment, and ultimately adult neurochemistry and behavior consistent with neuropsychiatric disorders in humans, providing a molecular mechanism linking maternal inflammation to neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring. \u2767 Mild maternal inflammation, induced for 24 hours by the immunostimulant polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) actuates transcriptional changes in the placenta 24 and 48 hours after exposure in several genes coding for enzymes involved in the placental metabolism of tryptophan. This in turn leads to downstream changes in enzymatic activity, in which I see altered metabolic output of the placenta to the fetus. This is accompanied by changes in fetal neurochemistry, where I see increased forebrain concentrations of serotonin after 24 and 48 hours, indicating that mild maternal inflammation induces a placental cascade that indirectly impacts fetal neurochemistry during development. Furthermore, this cascade leads to blunted outgrowth of serotonergic axons from the dorsal raphe into the forebrain, and increased cellular proliferation specifically within the thalamus 48 hours after maternal exposure to poly(I:C). \u2767 When looking postnatally, I find that prenatal exposure to poly(I:C) and the resulting placental metabolic cascade have long-term consequences on neurological function in the offspring. Adolescent offspring from poly(I:C) exposed dams have significantly increased concentrations of serotonin specifically within the thalamus, and impacted behavior in a manner consistent with sub-phenotypes of human patients suffering from ASD and schizophrenia. Specifically, adolescent offspring exhibit altered depressive- and anxiety-like behavior, and deficits in latent inhibition. This suggests that the prenatal cascade triggered by maternal inflammation has long-term consequences that persist through adolescence: altered placental tryptophan metabolism due to maternal inflammation indirectly impacts fetal neurochemistry, leading to altered fetal neurodevelopment and adolescent neurological function and behavior. Finally, I outline the methodology of our novel placental perfusion system, and demonstrate its efficacy for studying transplacental transfer of other TRP metabolites. While not outlined in this dissertation, it\u2019s also worth noting that I used the ex vivo perfusion system for the study of transplacental transfer dynamics of the maternally derived hormone osteocalcin (Oury et al., 2013), and the transfer of intact viruses such as the zika virus (manuscript in preparation).", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-333976", "publicationDate": "2017-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-333976", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Kingman's coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the effective population size as a function of time.  Major goals of demographic reconstruction include identifying driving factors of effective population size, and understanding the association between the effective population size and such factors.  Building upon Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible framework that incorporates time-varying covariates that exploit Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of effective population size trajectories.  To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models.  Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories.  Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics.  We apply our model to four examples.  We reconstruct the demographic history of raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak.  Next, we examine the effective population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns.  We compare the population history of the HIV-1 CRF02_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective of incidence rate.

Here, by extending Kimura's model of compensatory evolution at interacting sites, we show that the ratio of transition to transversion substitutions (\u03ba) at interacting sites should be equal to the square of the ratio at independent sites. Because transition mutations generally occur at a higher rate than transversions, the model predicts that \u03ba should be higher at interacting sites than at independent sites. We tested this prediction in 10 RNA secondary structures by comparing phylogenetically derived estimates of \u03ba in paired sites within stems (\u03ba(p)) and unpaired sites within loops (\u03ba(u)). Eight of the 10 structures showed an excellent match to the quantitative predictions of the model, and 9 of the 10 structures matched the qualitative prediction \u03ba(p) &gt; \u03ba(u). Only the Rev response element from the human immunovirus (HIV) genome showed the reverse pattern, with \u03ba(p) &lt; \u03ba(u). Although a variety of evolutionary forces could produce quantitative deviations from the model predictions, the reversal in magnitude of \u03ba(p) and \u03ba(u) could be achieved only by violating the model assumption that the underlying transition (or transversion) mutation rates were identical in paired and unpaired regions of the molecule. We explore the ability of the APOBEC3 enzymes, host defense mechanisms against retroviruses, which induce transition mutations preferentially in single-stranded regions of the HIV genome, to explain this exception to the rule.

Using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes with and without the piscivorous bigmouth sleeper (Gobiomorus dormitor), we provide some of the strongest tests of these predictions to date, as resource availability does not co-vary with predation regime in this system, and we examine numerous (14) isolated natural populations. We found clear evidence for the expected life-history divergence between predation regimes, and empirical support of the Trexler-DeAngelis model.

All polyploid species are allopolyploids. Among the four diploid gene pools, the propensity for allopolyploidization is unevenly distributed phylogenetically with a few species apparently more prone to participate, but the underlying causes remain unclear. Polyploid genomes are characterized by differential loss of ribosomal DNA loci (5S and 35S rDNA), known hotspots of chromosomal evolution, but show genome size additivity, suggesting limited changes beyond those affecting rDNA loci or the presence of processes counterbalancing genome reduction.

In a replicated greenhouse experiment with the aquatic microbial community that inhabits the cup-shaped leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea, we monitored O2 levels and the concentration of bovine serum album (BSA), an effective molecular substitute for detritus. Low BSA enrichment rates triggered a classic hysteresis response, a substantial lag in the return of O2 levels. At intermediate BSA enrichment rates, O2 levels closely tracked BSA concentrations during both the enrichment and recovery phases. High BSA enrichment rates induced an unusual \"anti-clockwise\" hysteresis in which O2 levels were higher during the recovery phase than during the enrichment phase. These experiments revealed complex dynamic behavior in response to enrichment rates of a single environmental driver. Our results suggest that the past trajectory of enrichment is critical for understanding how systems will respond to restoration initiatives. Specifically, systems that have been exposed to chronic low levels of enrichment may be the ones that are most resistant to restoration efforts that reduce nutrient or detrital inputs.", "doi": "10.6073/pasta/ebf6b175a6f6e44d3e9747c13f0d376c", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-hfr.334.1", "method": null, "source": "edi.edi", "type_cont": null},

However distinct evolutionary trajectories among traits and markers can lead to their discordance. First, geographic structure in phenotypic traits and nuclear molecular markers can be co-aligned but inconsistent with mtDNA (mito-nuclear discordance). Alternatively, phenotypic variation can have little to do with patterns in neither mtDNA nor nuclear markers. Disentangling between these distinct patterns can provide insight into the role of selection, demography and gene flow in population divergence. Here we examined a previously reported case of strong inconsistency between geographic structure in mtDNA and plumage traits in a widespread polytypic bird species, the White Wagtail (Motacilla alba). We tested whether this pattern is due to mito-nuclear discordance or discrepancy between morphological evolution and both nuclear and mtDNA markers. We analyzed population differentiation and structure across six out of nine commonly recognized subspecies using 17 microsatellite loci and a combination of microsatellites and plumage indices in a comprehensively sampled region of a contact between two subspecies. We did not find support for the mito-nuclear discordance hypothesis: nuclear markers indicated a subtle signal of genetic clustering only partially consistent with plumage groups, similar to previous findings that relied on mtDNA. We discuss evolutionary factors that could have shaped the intricate patterns of phenotypic diversification in the White wagtail and the role that repeated selection on plumage \u201chotspots\u201d and hybridization may have played.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.nn34452", "publicationDate": "2018-05-31", "dateAvailable": "2018-05-31", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nn34452", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, macroevolutionary analyses based upon molecular phylogenies have difficulty inferring extinction dynamics, raising questions about whether the neontological record can contribute to an understanding of the decline phenomenon. Two recently developed diversification methods for molecular phylogenies (RPANDA and BAMM) incorporate models that theoretically have the capacity to capture decline dynamics by allowing extinction to be higher than speciation. However, the performance of these frameworks over a wide range of decline scenarios has not been studied. Here we investigate the behavior of these methods under decline scenarios caused by decreasing speciation and increasing extinction through time on simulated trees at fixed intervals over diversity trajectories with expansion and decline phases. We also compared method performance over a comprehensive dataset of 214 empirical trees. Our results show that both methods perform equally well when varying speciation rates control decline. When decline was only caused by an increase in extinction rates both methods wrongly assign the variation in net diversification to a drop in speciation, even though the positive gamma values of those trees would suggest otherwise. We also found a tendency for RPANDA to favor increasing extinction and BAMM to favor decreasing speciation as the most common cause of decline in empirical trees. Overall our results shed light on the limitations of both methods, encouraging researchers to carefully interpret the results from diversification studies.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.tt10r84", "publicationDate": "2018-05-11", "dateAvailable": "2018-05-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tt10r84", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In common with other membrane protein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers and protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules. We study here a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold reaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to capture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and characteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that our stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field models of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of analytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction dynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we find substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the reaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion properties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous experiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed single-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates at which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Finally, inspired by our results on synaptic domains, we investigate the diffusion of particles through media with spatially inhomogeneous particle hopping rates, both in the presence and absence of steric constraints on the particle density. Based on the deterministic parts of the corresponding lattice Langevin equations we obtain general solutions for the fractions of all particles in regions with distinct particle hopping rates, for arbitrary spatial dimensions of the system and numbers of distinct particle species. We confirm our general solutions using KMC simulations.

This study was designed to investigate the seasonal characteristics and source apportionment of organic aerosols during both clean days and haze events. Time-resolved concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols and organic molecular tracers were measured at Pinggu, a rural site of Beijing during the winter of 2016 and summer 2017 within an intensive sampling campaign. The Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) receptor model was applied to estimate the average source contributions to organic carbon (OC) at Pinggu based on molecular markers for primary and secondary organic aerosols. The concentration of OC in winter is comparable with previous studies, but decreased significantly during summer. The CMB model apportioned to seven separate primary sources, which explained on average 73.8% on haze days and 81.2% on clean days of the organic carbon in winter, including vegetative detritus, biomass burning, gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, industrial coal combustion, residential coal combustion and cooking. A slightly lower percentage of OC was apportioned in the summer campaign with 64.5% and 78.7% accounted for on moderate and good days. The other unapportioned OC is considered to consist of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed through chemical reactions in the atmosphere. During haze episodes in winter, coal combustion and SOA were the dominant sources of organic carbon with 23.3% and 26.2% of OC, respectively, followed by biomass burning emissions (20%), indicating that combustion activities and secondary formation play significant roles in particulate matter accumulation, whereas in summer, industrial coal combustion and SOC are important sources. Diurnal contribution cycles for coal combustion and biomass burning showed a peak at 6-9 pm, suggesting cooking and heating were predominantly responsible for organic aerosols in this rural area. The backward trajectory analysis showed that high mass concentrations of OC were measured when the air mass was from the south, suggesting that the organic aerosols in Pinggu were mainly affected by both local emissions and regional transport from central Beijing and Hebei province during haze episodes.

Our results show that platyrrhines originated 5\u201310 million years earlier than previously assumed, dating back to the Middle Eocene. The estimated ancestral platyrrhine was small \u2013 weighing 0.4 kg \u2013 and matched the size of their presumed African ancestors. As the three platyrrhine families diverged, we recover a rapid change in body mass range. During the Miocene Climatic Optimum, fossil diversity peaked and platyrrhines reached their widest latitudinal range, expanding as far South as Patagonia, favored by warm and humid climate and the lower elevation of the Andes. Finally, global cooling and aridification after the middle Miocene triggered a geographic contraction of New World monkeys and increased their extinction rates. These results unveil the full evolutionary trajectory of an iconic and ecologically important radiation of monkeys and showcase the necessity of integrating fossil and molecular data for reliably estimating evolutionary rates and trends.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.sv43650", "publicationDate": "2018-06-18", "dateAvailable": "2018-06-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sv43650", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations. 2. The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterising migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data. 3. We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters, and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations. 4. All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, i.e., they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50% of the single cases, i.e. they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to \u2018less-stereotyped\u2019 cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations. 5. We suggest 3 steps to identify improper inferences from migration data, and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend: a) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, b) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences, and c) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e., less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.rg0v3", "publicationDate": "2015-09-28", "dateAvailable": "2015-09-28", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rg0v3", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Migration is often defined by spatial separation of seasonal ranges and consequently, classification of individuals as migrants or residents is usually only based on geographic criteria. However, the underlying mechanism for migration is hypothesized to be movement in response to spatiotemporal resource variability and thus, migrants are assumed to travel an \u2018ecological distance\u2019 or shift their realized ecological niches. While ecological and geographic distances should be related, their relationship may depend on landscape heterogeneity. Here, we tested the utility of ecological niche theory to both classify migratory individuals and to understand the underlying ecological factors for migratory behavior. We developed an integrative approach combining measures in geographic and ecological niche space and used this to classify and explain migratory behavior of 71 annual roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) movement trajectories in five European study areas. Firstly, to assess the utility of the ecological distance concept for classifying migratory behavior, we tested whether roe deer sought the same ecological conditions year-round or moved to different ecological conditions by measuring the annual ecological distance travelled and the seasonal niche overlap using multivariate statistics. Comparing methods to classify migrants and residents based on geographic and ecological niche space, we found that migratory roe deer switched between seasons both in geographic and in ecological dimensions. Secondly, we tested which seasonal ecological factors separated resident from migrant niches using discriminant analysis and which broad-scale determinants (e.g., spatiotemporal forage variation and population density) predicted migration probability using generalized linear models. Our results indicated that factors describing forage and topographic variability discriminated seasonal migrant from resident niches. Determinants for predicting migration probability included the temporal variation (seasonality) and also the spatial variability of forage patches. Lastly, we also found suggestive evidence for a positive relationship between population density and migration probability. By applying the ecological niche concept to the study of partial migration in ungulates, our work underlines that partial migration is a form of behavioral plasticity.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.95930", "publicationDate": "2017-01-10", "dateAvailable": "2017-01-10", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.95930", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However estimating Ne, and identifying key demographic mechanisms that underlie the Ne to census population size (N) ratio, remains challenging, especially for small populations with overlapping generations and substantial environmental and demographic stochasticity and hence dynamic age-structure.\n\n2.A sophisticated demographic method of estimating Ne/N, which uses Fisher's reproductive value to account for dynamic age-structure, has been formulated. However this method requires detailed individual- and population-level data on sex- and age-specific reproduction and survival, and has rarely been implemented.\n\n3.Here we use the reproductive value method and detailed demographic data to estimate Ne/N for a small and apparently isolated red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population of high conservation concern. We additionally calculated two single-sample molecular genetic estimates of Ne to corroborate the demographic estimate and examine evidence for unobserved immigration and gene flow.\n\n4.The demographic estimate of Ne/N was 0.21, reflecting a high total demographic variance (\u03c32dg) of 0.71.

Our analyses identify key sex-age classes contributing to demographic variance and thus decreasing Ne/N in a small age-structured population inhabiting a variable environment. They thereby demonstrate how assessments of Ne can incorporate stochastic sex- and age-specific demography and elucidate key demographic processes affecting a population's evolutionary trajectory and viability. Furthermore, our analyses show that Ne for the focal chough population is critically small, implying that management to re-establish genetic connectivity may be required to ensure population viability.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.68kk0", "publicationDate": "2017-05-31", "dateAvailable": "2017-05-31", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.68kk0", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Comparison of the electrical properties from the simulations and the experiments indicated excellent agreement as well.

Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sam- pling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfor- tunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncer- tain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation timescales, so proper sampling with cur- rent techniques can require prohibitively long sim- ulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligandis rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over two orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics sim- ulation. This is a first step towards applying this methodology to pharmaceutically-relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules.

Recently, next-generation sequencing has been applied to questions about organismal history, with the promise of revolutionizing the field. However, no systematic assessment of how phylogeographic data sets have changed over time with respect to overall size and information content has been performed. Here, we quantify the changing nature of these genetic data sets over the past 20 years, focusing on papers published in Molecular Ecology. We found that the number of independent loci, the total number of alleles sampled and the total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per data set has improved over time, with particularly dramatic increases within the past 5 years. Interestingly, uniparentally inherited organellar markers (e.g. animal mitochondrial and plant chloroplast DNA) continue to represent an important component of phylogeographic data. Single-species studies (cf. comparative studies) that focus on vertebrates (particularly fish and to some extent, birds) represent the gold standard of phylogeographic data collection. Based on the current trajectory seen in our survey data, forecast modelling indicates that the median number of SNPs per data set for studies published by the end of the year 2016 may approach ~20 000.

Tyro3, Axl and Mer are members of TAM RTKs and are overexpressed in several cancer forms. Kinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib, foretinib are reported to inhibit TAM kinases at nanomolar concentrations. The atomistic details of structure and mechanism of functional regulation is required to understand their normal physiological process and when bound to an inhibitor. The docking of cabozantinib into the active state conformations of TAM kinases (crystal structure and computational models) revealed the best binding pose and the complex formation that is mediated through non-bonding interactions involving the hinge region residues. The alterations in the conformations and the regions of flexibility in apo and complexed TAM kinases as a course of time are studied using 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The post-MD trajectory analysis using Python libraries like ProDy, MDTraj and PyEMMA revealed encrypted protein dynamic motions in active kinetic metastable states. Comparison between Principal component analysis and Anisotropic mode analysis deciphered structural residue interactions and salt bridge contacts between apo and inhibitor bound TAM kinases. Various structural changes occurred in \u03b1C-helix and activation loop involving hydrogen bonding between residues from Lys-(\u03b23 sheet), Glu-(\u03b1C-helix) and Asp-(DFG-motif) resulting in higher RMSD.

The fossil record is a valuable source of data for studying past changes in community composition, but it is not always detailed enough to allow the process of community assembly to be resolved at regional or site scales while tracing the trajectories of known species with associated known traits.\n\nWe present a three\u2010step framework for studying present\u2010day species accumulation through time: DNA sampling from multiple individuals from multiple species within a community; estimates of coalescence times for each species using molecular dating methods; and plotting the accumulation of present\u2010day species through time using the inferred population ages. Our approach is illustrated using whole chloroplast genomes from plants from three rainforest communities in eastern Australia. Expected times to coalescence for multiple species in each community were inferred from pooled high\u2010throughput sequence libraries. Local assemblage accumulation curves for each community were constructed. We also explored the variation in assemblage accumulation curves of species with different functional traits.\n\nModels of equilibrium species richness informed our null hypothesis and largely explained the shape of the assemblage accumulation curves and indicated that the complexities of the accumulation process should be explored with additional parameters, for example allowing species classes with different extinction rates. The assemblage accumulation curves for the study sites showed evidence of recent population expansions within each of the communities. This signal of recent accumulation is consistent with the increase in suitable rainforest habitat that followed the Last Glacial Maximum.\n\nOur method of constructing assemblage accumulation curves provides a simple approach for visualizing species\u2010accumulation data. It can be used to test hypotheses such as the relative survival potential of species\u2010specific ecological attributes. Although our example used single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms derived from whole\u2010chloroplast sequencing, this framework can be applied to mitochondrial genomes and to communities of other organisms.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.4rn1q84", "publicationDate": "2019-04-18", "dateAvailable": "2019-04-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4rn1q84", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active matter systems may be optimized to produce highly dissipative dynamical states, hence, leading to spontaneous emergence of more ordered states. This interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent one of the most salient examples of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of dissipa- tion optimization. In order to start addressing this question using detailed computational modeling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform, which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical re- actions and relaxation of mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. This is done by computing precise changes in Gibbs free energy accompanying chemical reactions using a novel formula, and through detailed calculations of instantaneous values of the system\u2019s mechanical energy. We validate our approach with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self- organization of small disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we do not observe that spontaneous network reorganizations lead to increases in the total dissipation rate as predicted by the dissipation- driven adaptation hypothesis mentioned above. However, whether such a principle operates in more general, more complex cytoskeletal networks remains to be investigated.,", "doi": "10.13016/t8oa-9qra", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.13016%2Ft8oa-9qra", "method": null, "source": "umd.lib", "type_cont": null},

In this context, we assessed genetic structure within a marine species with high dispersal potential, the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis). Using 19 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial control region sequences, population structure was investigated in the western North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the Azores Islands. Analyses of the microsatellite data identified four distinct genetic clusters, which were supported by the control region sequences. The highest level of divergence was seen between two clusters corresponding to previously-described morphotypes that inhabit oceanic and shelf waters. The combined morphological and genetic evidence suggests these two lineages are on distinct evolutionary trajectories and could be considered distinct subspecies despite their parapatry. Further analysis of the continental shelf cluster resulted in three groups: animals inhabiting shelf waters in the western North Atlantic, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the western Gulf of Mexico. Analyses of environmental data indicate the four genetic clusters inhabit distinct habitats in terms of depth and sea surface temperature. Contemporary dispersal rate estimates suggest all of these populations should be considered as distinct management units. Conversely, no significant genetic differentiation was observed between S. frontalis from offshore waters of the western North Atlantic and the Azores, which are separated by approximately 4500 km. Overall, the hierarchical structure observed within the Atlantic spotted dolphin shows that the biogeography of the species is complex because it is not shaped solely by geographic distance.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.j697v", "publicationDate": "2014-09-17", "dateAvailable": "2014-09-17", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.j697v", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Tyro3, Axl and Mer are members of TAM RTKs and are overexpressed in several cancer forms. Kinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib, foretinib are reported to inhibit TAM kinases at nanomolar concentrations. The atomistic details of structure and mechanism of functional regulation is required to understand their normal physiological process and when bound to an inhibitor. The docking of cabozantinib into the active state conformations of TAM kinases (crystal structure and computational models) revealed the best binding pose and the complex formation that is mediated through non-bonding interactions involving the hinge region residues. The alterations in the conformations and the regions of flexibility in apo and complexed TAM kinases as a course of time are studied using 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The post-MD trajectory analysis using Python libraries like ProDy, MDTraj and PyEMMA revealed encrypted protein dynamic motions in active kinetic metastable states. Comparison between Principal component analysis and Anisotropic mode analysis deciphered structural residue interactions and salt bridge contacts between apo and inhibitor bound TAM kinases.

We used a mapping population of 48 accessions (i) that maximize the genetic diversity of a local population of A. thaliana and (ii) that have been genotyped for 168 503 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms\nIn a common garden experiment, those 48 accessions were grown in six competitive environments: absence of competition, intraspecific competition and interspecific competition with four species frequently associated with A. thaliana in natural plant communities (i.e. Poa annua, Stellaria media, Trifolium repens and Veronica arvensis). A suite of nine phenotypic traits, including a proxy of fitness, were scored on each target A. thaliana plant and the above-ground dry biomass of its corresponding competitor was estimated\nWe first showed that crossing reaction norms of competitive response (A. thaliana performance) and effect (competitor biomass) might promote maintenance of genetic variation in a local population of A. thaliana and species co-existence at a fine spatial scale. By estimating genotypic gradients of selection, we then demonstrated that the optimal phenotypic strategies in response to competition depend on the identity of the competitor species. Finally, a Genome-Wide Association mapping approach highlighted that genomic regions associated with direct genetic effects were (i) dependent on the competitor species and (ii) different from genomic regions associated with interspecific indirect genetic effects\nWhile a first step, this study highlighted the power of adding ecology to genomics in A. thaliana to identify genetic bases underlying micro-geographic adaptation to competition.

The mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are in the JM8.N4 background (Pettitt et al., 2009) and the human cells were U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Cell lines expressing Halo-tagged proteins were either homozygous knock-in cell lines, wild-type cell lines transiently transfected with a plasmid over-expressing the protein of interest (Lipofectamine 3000), or wild-type cell lines stably over-expressing a transgene.\n\nThe wild-type and C59 mESC cell lines were pathogen tested using the IMPACT II test (performed by IDEXX BioResearch) and where negative for all tested pathogens (full details provided in (Hansen et al., 2017)). The wild-type and C32 U2OS cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination and found to be clean and further authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat Profiling (STR profiling; 100% match with U2OS; full details provided in (Hansen et al., 2017)).\n\nFurther details on each cell line or transfection construct are provided in the table in the ReadMe PDF (the MAT-file name is the name of the MAT-file containing the raw data).\n\nData collection using stroboscopic photo-activation single-particle tracking (spaSPT)\n\nFor full details on how the experiments where performed, please see the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript. Here we will briefly describe the protocol.\n\nTo systematically investigate how proteins explore the nucleus we need a very large dataset (i.e. hundreds of thousands of trajectories) of very high quality SPT data (i.e. with minimal bias and without many tracking errors). The two major sources of bias in experimental SPT data are 1) motion-blurring and 2) tracking errors (Hansen et al., 2018). First, motion-blurring biases against detecting fast-moving molecules since while the camera is exposed, a fast-moving molecule will spread its photons over many pixels and no longer resemble a diffraction limited spot, whereas a bound or slow-moving molecule will emit all its photons as a single diffraction limited spot. Since most localization algorithms readily detect diffraction limited spots, but not motion-blurs this introduces a clear bias. spaSPT overcomes this bias by strobing the excitation laser (Elf et al., 2007): using just a single 1 ms excitation pulse, we simultaneously achieve high signal-to-background (~10-fold), while minimizing motion-blur as previously demonstrated (for a more complete discussion, please see (Hansen et al., 2018)). Second, tracking errors are largely caused by high particle densities: for example, when trajectories overlap, tracking errors occur which clearly prevents accurately analysis of protein diffusion and which could lead to artefactual conclusions. By using the bright photo-activatable Janelia Fluor dyes PA-JF549 and PA-JF646 (Grimm et al., 2016), we can overcome this challenge (this is also known as sptPALM (Manley et al., 2008)). During the camera integration time between frame (~447 microseconds), we pulse the 405 nm photo-activation laser at an intensity such that the mean localization density is around 1 molecule per nucleus per frame. At this density, tracking errors are greatly reduced, yet we are able to collect tens of thousands of frames at this density per cell and thus obtain large amounts of data despite imaging at a very low density. For a more complete discussion of spaSPT please see (Hansen et al., 2017, 2018).\n\nTo generate a large dataset at multiple time-scales, we collected spaSPT data (generally around 8 cells per replicate and four biological replicates; occasionally a cell would be removed from subsequent analysis if the localization density was too high and thus prone to tracking errors) at 3 camera exposure times: 4 ms (add ~447 microseconds), 7 ms (add ~447 microseconds) and 13 ms (add ~447 microseconds); this roughly corresponds to frame-rates of ~223 Hz, 133 Hz, and 74 Hz. To generate data at longer lag times (this was only done after HMM-classification; see also main paper), this data was subsampled according to the table in the ReadMe PDF.\n\nOverview of raw, unprocessed single-cell spaSPT data\n\nThis repository contains all the raw, unprocessed spaSPT data for each single cell in the directory \u201cUnprocessedSingleCellData\u201d. In total, this directory contains 1669 MAT-files corresponding to the 1669 single-movies recorded here. The files are systematically named for their parent cell line, replicate number and cell number. For example, \u201cmESC_C59_Halo-mCTCF_133Hz_Rep4_Cell8.mat\u201d contains SPT data for mouse embryonic stem cell line clone 59 and Halo-CTCF was imaged at ~133 Hz; the file is for cell number 8 in biological replicate number 4. All the other single-cell experiments are similarly named. Each MAT-file contain all the trajectories recording from a single-cell movie and stored as a \u201cstructure array\u201d object, \u201ctrackedPar\u201d. trackedPar contains three variables for each trajectory:\n\n\n\ttrackedPar.xy: \u201cxy\u201d is a matrix with 2 columns and a number of rows corresponding to the number of frames where the molecule was located. The first column is the x-coordinate and the second column is the y-coordinate and the units are micrometers.\n\ttrackedPar.Frame: \u201cFrame\u201d is a column vector where each element is an integer describing the frame number wherein the particle was localized (each trajectory contains at most 1 gap between frames).\n\ttrackedPar.TimeStamp: \u201cTimeStamp\u201d is a column vector where each element is the timepoint (in units of seconds) where the molecule was localized.\n\n\nNote that this Matlab format is directly readable by Spot-On: https://spoton.berkeley.edu/\n\n \n\nOverview of HMM-classified and processed SPT data\n\nThe raw spaSPT data was processed (to remove any rare tracking errors) and all the data merged. The data was the classified into either a \u201cbound\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d state using a 2-state Hidden-Markov Model (HHM; vbSPT (Persson et al., 2013)) and then temporally subsampled to generate data at longer frame rates. Full details on how the data was processed are given in the Materials and Methods section as well as on GitLab. Raw code to reproduce all the figures from unprocessed single-cell spaSPT data is also available at GitLab: https://gitlab.com/anders.sejr.hansen/anisotropy\n\nAll the HMM-classified data for each cell line at each frame rate is stored in a single MAT-file. The MAT-file contains two key cell arrays: \u201cCellTracks\u201d and \u201cCellTrackViterbiClass\u201d. The two cell arrays contain the XY-coordinates and classification, respectively. More, specifically, suppose trajectory k is made up of n localizations. Then:\n\nCellTracks{k}: a matrix of n rows and 2 columns containing the x,y coordinates in units of micrometers.\n\nCellTrackViterbiClass{k}: a column vector of length n-1 where each entry is an integer: either \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d. Thus, the length of this vector is 1 less than the number of rows in the CellTracks matrix. This is because only the displacements and not the localizations are classified. For example, the CellTrackViterbiClass{k} reads [1;1;1;2;2] it means that there were 6 localizations and that the first 3 displacements (1\u00e02, 2\u00e03, 3\u00e04) were classified as \u201cbound\u201d and the last 2 displacements (4\u00e05, 5\u00e06) were classified as \u201cfree\u201d.  \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences\n\nElf, J., Li, G.-W., and Xie, X.S.

Furthermore, the subtleties of the reactive surfaces and the effect of external forces such as solvent electrostatics and molecular collisions on these surfaces often play a major role in the reaction outcome.  Many of these external effects begin influencing the reaction within tens of femtoseconds, requiring sophisticated experimental techniques in order to observe dynamics on these timescales.; Ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy is employed to study the benchmark ICN \u00c3 photodissociation reaction.  This prototypical triatomic system is known to produce a highly non-equilibrium distribution of rotationally excited cyano radicals.  The generation of these rotors comes from a non-adiabatic transition which applies extra torque to an already rapidly bending I-CN bond and leads to two product states corresponding to the I*(\u00b2P1/2) + cold CN and I(\u00b2P3/2) + hot CN channel.  Simulations show that this rotationally excited CN pushes solvent molecules out of the way to create a cavity where free rotation takes place for several picoseconds.  Our hypothesis is that this spinning CN resembles a gas phase molecule, and thus should have a gas phase spectral signature.; Although the relaxation of the hot CN takes place on relatively long time scales for ultrafast spectroscopists, the initial curve crossing event takes place much earlier (&lt;30 fs) and not much is known about the influence of the solvent on this process.  Using sub 40 fs DUV pulses compressed by a novel Gires-Tournois pulse compression system and multiplexed  broadband probing, we can interrogate this reaction at much higher levels of detail than previously possible.  A clear signature from the gas-phase-like CN B\u2190X transition is observed in both water and ethanol.  The spectral contributions of I(\u00b2P3/2)  and I*(\u00b2P1/2)  can be removed from the transient spectrum, because of new and independent experiments also reported here that capture these spectra by photodetachment of iodide in ethanol.  This analysis allows us to watch the evolution of the CN band and estimate first pass curve-crossing probabilities for the first time in solution.; Semiclassical molecular dynamics simulations of ICN bond breaking in water including the non-adiabatic transition, allow us to microscopically break down the energy flow which takes place immediately after dissociation.  Using a spectroscopic sorting criteria which follows only freely dissociated trajectories, we can compare the simulation directly to our experimental observables for the first time.; Future work is needed to measure the equilibrium spectrum of the CN radical in the absence of iodine transients as a last reference, but, with our current time resolution and the ability to simultaneously image the absorption spectrum of multiple transient species as a function of time, we are much closer to extracting all pertinent information from a movie of this benchmark solution phase reaction occurring in real time.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3636", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3636", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

By using quantum\u2010mechanical principles, these methods enable solution of complex chemical problems by using the power of computers. Knowing only the positions and types of the atoms, one can calculate virtually all the properties of the molecules such as charge distributions, dipole moments, reaction and excitation energies. Among ab initio techniques coupled cluster (CC) and equation\u2010of\u2010motion EOM family of methods plays a special role. These methods enable accurate and systematic treatment of electron correlation for both the ground and excited states. Accurate recovery of electron correlation is essential for achieving chemical accuracy in calculations (1 kCal/mol). \u2767 In Chapter 2 we present high level ab initio calculations of the electronic structure of the two isomers of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) model chromophores. We found that the phenolate and carboxylate isomers of the model chromophore (para\u2010coumaric acid, pCA) have distinctly different pattern of ionization and excitation energies, which contradicts published experimental results. Their excitation energies differ by more than 1 eV and the first excited states in both isomers are autoionizing resonances. The phenolate form of pCA exhibits shape resonance, whereas for carboxylate we predicted Feshbach\u2010type resonance. Next, in Chapter 3, we investigate how microhydration affects the electronic structure of the PYP and GFP model chromophores. We found that microhydration leads to a larger blue shift in ionization than in excitation energy, thus converting resonances into bound states. \u2767 Following our findings of resonance states in gas\u2010phase chromophores we began the development of new methods for proper description of resonance positions and lifetimes. In Chapter 4 we extend EOM methods to atomic resonances by applying complex scaled formalism in which all coordinates are rotated by a complex angle \u03b8. By computing \u03b8\u2010trajectories and finding an optimal angle, we are able to find positions and lifetimes of the resonances in He, H-, and Be. For the description of molecular resonances, we use another approach in which we introduce complex absorbing potential (CAP) into the original Hamiltonian. CAP is devised to absorb the divergent tail of the resonance wave function. By using the CAP\u2010augmented Hamiltonian with EOM methods we study electronically attached shape resonances in various medium\u2010size molecules. We find that an artificial perturbation induced by the CAP can be diminished by introducing a first\u2010order correction to the energy. We also observe that the corrected energies are much less sensitive to the onset of the CAP (e.g., box size) and that accurate results can be obtained using standard basis sets augmented by diffuse functions. \u2767 In Chapter 6 improvement of the memory requirements in CC and EOM methods is presented. By performing Cholesky decomposition of the two\u2010electron integrals tensor we significantly reduce its storage requirements from O(N\u2074) to O(N\u00b3), which extends the applicability of the method to larger systems that may not be accessible by canonical EOM\u2010CCSD. The errors introduced by the decomposition are small and can be controlled by a single threshold specified by the user. \u2767 Finally, in Chapter 7 we present a new version of Davidson's algorithm for solving the eigenvalue problems in quantum chemical calculations. These new algorithms facilitate finding the roots either around the user\u2010specified energy shift or by user\u2010defined guess orbitals. These modifications will enable obtaining highly lying states that are not accessible using standard methods that find only the lowest eigenstates. Such enhancements will be useful for many applications, for example, in studies of core ionization processes where the ionization potential can be as high as hundreds of electron\u2010volts. We also present an implementation of a new method for non\u2010Hermitian eigenvalue problems within EOM family of methods, generalized preconditioned locally residual method (GPLMR), which also has the capabilities of finding interior eigenvalues around a specified shift. We present benchmarks for aforecited methods comparing their robustness and computational cost.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-416226", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-416226", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The essential task for the understanding of the regulatory mechanism(s) is thus to determine the temporal and spatial quantitative map of the time-evolving molecular states of the signaling network to enable building a physically reasonable and biologically meaningful model that not only describes the acquired data but also can generate testable hypotheses. Conventional approaches in biological science and bioengineering rely almost invariably on population-averaged measurements of usually a single biomarker at a limited number of fixed time points. The true trajectories of the dynamics of multiple biomarkers of the cellular response and their cell-to-cell variation are thus averaged over and masked. In turn this limits the reliability and scope of the model(s) built upon such measurements. To overcome these limitations, in this dissertation, we introduced and followed the new paradigm of measuring simultaneously in real-time indicators / biomarkers of multiple processes in a statistically large number of individual live cells from the same population under controlled stress over prolonged times. Such an approach, increasingly recognized in recent years as central to pursuing a systems perspective of biological processes, including those underlying disease, demanded the availability of appropriate experimental platform. Fortunately the Madhukar laboratory was embarked upon developing such a platform and this author could join Dr. Siyuan Lu in this effort. Thus a custom-designed high-throughput real-time live-cell imaging platform that allows optical imaging of multiple fluorescence biomarkers while also imaging morphological changes in a network of live cells was developed, tested, and applied to the study of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Specifically, the mitochondria-mediated (i.e. intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) line differentiated RGC-5, induced by elevated hydrostatic pressure is examined via simultaneous imaging of five features: the time-dependant concentration of (1) intracellular Ca2+, (2) caspase-3/7 activation, (3) phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, and the morphological changes of (4) cell body shrinkage and (5) neurite retraction. Simultaneous measurement of five features in apoptosis, and perhaps for any biological process, in a statistically large number of individual live cells under continuous stress is a first. It has enabled the following major findings for apoptosis: (1) resolving a controversy in the literature, the mechanism of the observed apoptotic morphological change of cell body shrinkage at the early stage can now be attributed to the ion channel activities regulating water efflux as evidenced by the strong temporal correlation between the early intracellular Ca2+ elevation and the cell body shrinkage; (2) the first quantitative evidence for significant cell-to-cell variation in the time interval between the onset of Ca2+ elevation at the early stage of apoptosis and the time of caspase-3/7 activation at the later stages of apoptosis and (3) the appearance of multiple stages in PS translocation from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, suggesting more than a single mechanism of PS translocation to be operative in RGC apoptosis under elevated pressure. \u2767 The acquisition of data on the dynamics of five features is not only a first, equally significant, the acquired Ca2+ data have enabled, for the first time, the modeling and analysis of the role of [Ca2+] in apoptosis. Although Ca2+ dynamics in normal healthy cells under physiological conditions has been measured, modeled, and analyzed for quite some time, the model proposed and analyzed here is the first one for [Ca2+] dynamics during apoptosis. The physical model proposed is guided by the seminal work of Boehning et al. [Nat. Cell Biol. 5 (2003)] who showed the significance of the cytochrome c released by the mitochondria for impacting the free cytosolic [Ca2+] via its binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Specifically, the impact of cytochrome c binding to IP3R is modeled as a change in the IP3R opening probability expression employed by Mak et al. [PNAS, 95 (1998)] in the modeling of [Ca2+] dynamics in non-apoptotic cells. The model provides a qualitative understanding of the [Ca2+] dynamics in apoptosis for reasonable values of the parameters involved. \u2767 As PS translocation gives rise to an increase in its concentration at the cell surface, we also carried out a unique study utilizing combined NSOM-AFM (Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy - Atomic force microscopy) that allowed simultaneous imaging of the 3-dimensional topography of the cell surface and the local density of PS as manifest in the fluorescence intensity of Annexin-V conjugated to the PS measured at the nanoscale beyond the diffraction limit. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient 0.69) between the geometrical height and the density of the PS on the surface of the RGC-5 cell membrane is found. It suggests that this may be Nature\u2019s way of signaling for and enabling a means for effective binding of the associated receptors in phagocytes to the translocated PS in the apoptotic cell. \u2767 To investigate the very origin of RGC apoptosis under elevated pressure, we undertook examination of the neurotrophin deprivation hypothesis\u2014namely that the blockage of neurotrophin uptake/transport through axon induces apoptosis in RGCs under elevated pressure. This was carried out employing dye as well as QD-tagged neurotrophins and for cells cultured in custom-designed microfluidic chips that enable isolation of the cell soma and processes. This ensures unambiguous measurements of spatially separated uptake regions and axonal transport of the neurotrophins. For the uptake studies, the cells employed are the differentiated RGC-5 cell line whereas for the axonal transport studies only the neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells were employed as these provide mature axons (unlike RGC-5 neurites which are not sufficiently mature). Reduction in the number of neurotrophin uptaken into the differentiated RGC-5 cells and more neurotrophins localized in the neurites were found under the elevated pressure of 100 mmHg compared to the cells under no elevated pressure. The neurotrophin transport in the neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells revealed a typical stop-and-go behavior. This suggests that the elevated pressure not only inhibits the overall uptake of the neurotrophins into RGCs but also potentially the transport through neurites in RGCs, thus providing the first evidence supporting the neurotrophin deprivation hypothesis of apoptosis.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c127-662046", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-662046", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

This does not mean that their environmental impacts can be overlooked. A UK government review recommended a pilot scheme lagoon go ahead, with careful environmental monitoring. Despite recent government rejection of a lagoon scheme, it is still more important than ever to consider environmental solution options for any future lagoon developments. There are no operating lagoons in the world and so their environmental impacts are not fully understood. However, there is a vast quantity of literature available from other industries addressing similar impacts in the coastal, ocean and river environments. This systematic review follows the PRISMA and CEE guidance. Using this methodology the available literature covering relevant solution options from other industries that could be applied to future lagoon developments was quantified. This presents an investigation into solution options only, giving a quantitative analysis of what resources are available, how this compares to industry understanding, where the expertise lies globally, what impacts are being addressed and how applicable the solutions are for lagoon application. This paper analyses the extent and relevance of this available research on solutions as a resource for the nascent lagoon industry. Over half of the solutions found in this review require only small shifts in development for them to be realistic solution options for the lagoon industry in the future. This review opens the door on a vast and valuable resource and justifies the need for further investigation into solutions for the lagoon industry.

Does topsoil removal in grassland restoration benefit both soil nematode and plant communities? Journal of Applied Ecology. [doi:10.16904/envidat.65](https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.65).Please cite this paper together with the citation for the datafile. Methods Study area and experimental settingsThe study was conducted in a nature reserve (Eigental: 47\u00b0 27\u2019 to 47\u00b0 29\u2019 N, 8\u00b0 37\u2019 E, 461 to 507 m a.s.l.) that is located on the Swiss Central plateau close to Zurich airport (Canton Zurich, Switzerland). The mean annual temperature in this area ranges from 8.9 to 10.6 \u00b0C, mean annual precipitation from 910 to 1260 mm [10-year average (2007-2017); MeteoSchweiz, 2018]. The main soil types are calcaric to gleyic Cambisol and Gleysols. The reserve was established in 1967 to protect small remnants of oligotrophic semi-natural grasslands (roughly 12 ha). The plant community can be characterized as Molinion and Mesobromion (semi-wet to semi-dry), depending on the site-specific groundwater level and slope inclination (Delarze, Gonseth, Eggenberg, &amp; Vust, 2015). These remnants represent species-rich islands in an otherwise intensively managed agricultural landscape. Semi-natural grasslands covered an area of 60,000 ha in the Canton Zurich in 1939, however, by 2005 only roughly 600 ha remained (Baudirektion Kanton Z\u00fcrich, 2007). In 1990, the government of Canton Zurich decided to enlarge the nature reserve Eigental. The goal was to incorporate eleven patches of 20 ha adjacent intensively farmed land and transform these patches into semi-natural grasslands. The patches had a different agricultural history, ranging from permanent (no tillage for -50 years) to temporary grassland (as part of crop rotation; last tillage -5 years). On all freshly integrated patches fertilization was stopped in 1992 and from then on biomass was harvested three times a year and removed. After 5 years without noticeable effects on vegetation composition, the Nature Conservation Agency of Canton Zurich decided to increase the restoration efforts. In 1995, a large-scale experiment was initialized to evaluate if certain treatments can facilitate restoration within a reasonable timeframe of 5 to 10 years after treatment implementation.The three restoration treatments used were: i. \u201cHarvest only\u201d: Plots are being mowed two to three times a year and the biomass is removed.ii. \u201cTopsoil\u201d: Topsoil was removed to a depth of 10 to 20 cm, depending on the depth of the O and A horizon, in four randomly selected areas within each of the eleven patches in late autumn 1995. The size of each topsoil removal area depended on individual patch size and was between 2700 and 7000 m2. iii. \u201cTopsoil+Propagules\u201d: Propagules from target vegetation were added on half of the area where topsoil was removed, using fresh, seed-containing hay originating from a mixture of semi-dry to semi-wet species-rich grasslands of local provenance (within a radius of 7 km). Hay applications were conducted twice in 1995 and 1996. Repeated applications were chosen to account for the low quantity of available plant material per transfer, since area ratio between receptor and donor sites was roughly 1:1. In addition, hand-collected propagules from 15 selected target species of regional provenance (within a radius of 30 km) were equally applied in 1996 and 1997. \u201cTopsoil\u201d and \u201cTopsoil+Propagules\u201d plots are mowed once a year, and the biomass is removed. Mowing on these plots started five years after the treatment was implemented. Eleven permanent plots of 5 m x 5 m were randomly established in each treatment to monitor the vegetation development. The experiment was complemented with 11 control plots that represent the initial state of intensively managed grasslands, further referred to as \u201cInitial\u201d, and 11 control plots that represent the targeted state of donor sites for \u201cTopsoil+Propagules\u201d, further referred to as \u201cTarget\u201d. Consequently, the experiment consists of 55 plots (5 treatments x 11 replicates). Management of intensively used grasslands includes mowing and fertilizing (manure) between two to five times a year, as well as different tillage regimes (no tillage for -50 years; last time of tillage -5 years). Nematode and plant samplingSoil nematodes were sampled in 2 m x 2 m plots, randomly established at least 2 m away from the vegetation plots. We collected eight soil cores with a 2.2 cm diameter soil core sampler (Giddings Machine Company, Windsor, CO, USA) to a depth of 12 cm (representing the majority of the plant rooting system) in each plot at the beginning of July 2017. The eight cores within each replicate plot were combined, gently homogenized, placed in coolers and transported to the laboratory of NIOO in Wageningen, the Netherlands, within one week. Free-living nematodes were extracted from 200 g of fresh soil using Oostenbrink elutriator (Oostenbrink, 1960) and concentrated, resulting in 6 mL nematode solution. The nematode solution was subdivided into three subsamples, two for morphological identification and quantification, and one for molecular work (not used in this study). For morphological identification and quantification, nematodes were heat-killed at 90 \u00b0C and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde solution (final volume 10 mL per subsample). All nematodes in 1 mL of formaldehyde solution were counted, and a minimum of 150 individuals per 1 mL sample (or all if less nematodes were present) were identified to family level using Bongers (1988). We then extrapolated the numbers of each nematode taxa identified to the entire sample and expressed them per 100 g dry soil for further analyses. We calculated number of nematode taxa and Shannon diversity and assessed nematode community composition. In addition, we classified the nematode taxa into feeding types (herbivores, bacterivores, fungivores, omni-carnivores), structural and functional guilds (Table S4). Structural guilds assign nematode taxa according to life-history traits into five colonizer-persister (C-P) classes, ranging from one (early colonizers of new resources) to five (persisters in undisturbed habitats; Bongers 1990). C-P classes can be categorized as indicators for nutrient-enriched (C-P1), stressed (C-P2) and structured (C-P3 + C-P4 + C-P5) soil conditions (Ferris, Bongers, &amp; de Goede, 2001). Functional guilds assign nematode taxa according to their C-P classification combined with their feeding habits (Ferris, Bongers, &amp; de Goede, 2001). Based on the structural and functional guild classification we calculated five additional indices to assess soil nutrient status, disturbance and food web characteristics using NINJA (Sieriebriennikov, Ferris, &amp; de Goede, 2014). 1) The Maturity index indicates the degree of different environmental perturbations (e.g., tillage, nutrient enrichment, pollution) and is used to monitor colonization and subsequent succession after disturbances (Bongers, 1990). 2) The ratio between the Plant Parasite (C-P of herbivorous nematodes only) to Maturity index is used to monitor the recovery of disturbed habitats incorporating information of life-history traits for all feeding types (Bongers, van der Meulen, &amp; Korthals, 1997). 3) The Enrichment index indicates nutrient-enriched soils and agricultural management practices (Ferris, Bongers, &amp; de Goede, 2001). 4) The Structure index provides information about the succession stage of the soil food web and therefore correlates with the degree of maturity of an ecosystem (Ferris, Bongers, &amp; de Goede, 2001). 5) The Channel index provides information about the predominant decomposition pathways, where higher values stand for a higher proportion of energy transformed through the slow fungal decomposition channel (Ferris, Bongers, &amp; de Goede, 2001). In addition, the Structure and Enrichment indices can be displayed in a biplot where nematode assemblages are plotted along a structure (x-axis) and enrichment (y-axis) trajectory (increasing index values). Each biplot quadrat reflects different levels of disturbance, soil nutrient pools and decomposition pathways (Ferris, Bongers, &amp; de Goede, 2001). The plant surveys were conducted on the 25 m2 permanent plots in June 2017. Plant species cover was visually assessed according to the semi-quantitative cover-abundance scale of Braun-Blanquet (1964; nomenclature: Lauber &amp; Wagner, 1996). We calculated number of species and Shannon diversity, and assessed plant community composition. We also counted the number of target species (all species recorded in the eleven target plots plus propagules of species applied by hand, resulting in a total of 143 species) and categorized plant species into species of concern based on their red list status in Switzerland as well as their protection status in Switzerland and the Canton Zurich (Moser, Gygax, B\u00e4umler, Wyler, &amp; Palese, 2002). Furthermore, we calculated indicator values for soil moisture and soil nutrients for each species according to Landolt et al. (2010).

Inclusion/exclusion decision and extracted data from the documents are included.\n\nThree main types can be identified on the Web and on corporate networks: SOAP services, which use the homonym protocol and well established technologies, such as WSDL; RESTful services which employ HTTP directly and conform to the constraints of the REST architectural style; and event-oriented services that take the initiative in notifying their clients about relevant facts. The co-existence of these service types has brought considerable research interest on service type heterogeneity in Web Service composition. The research question of SLR is \"How are services of heterogeneous types (SOAP, RESTful and \\event-oriented services) composed?\".\n\nDocuments that may answer this question were searched in Scopus and IEEE Xplore, from conferences and journal sources, without a time limit. Search results were last updated in July 22, 2018 and yielded 63 relevant documents published from 2005 to 2018. \n\nMost works (48) target SOAP and RESTful services heterogeneity, followed by a smaller group of 18 targeting SOAP and event-oriented heterogeneity. The other two combinations, RESTful/event-oriented and SOAP/RESTful/event-oriented sum 5 documents. Among these documents, RESTful support was found to be incipient, with most documents violating constraints of the REST architectural style.
