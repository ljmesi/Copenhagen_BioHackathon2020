Zebrafish offer a unique opportunity to explore this issue, not only because a great deal is known about key developmental events in this species, but also because the clock starts on the very first day of development. In this study, we identified numerous rhythmic genes in zebrafish larvae, including the key transcriptional regulators neurod and cdx1b, which are involved in neuronal and intestinal differentiation, respectively. Rhythmic expression of neurod and several additional transcription factors was only observed in the developing retina. Surprisingly, these rhythms in expression commenced at a stage of development after these transcription factors are known to have played their essential role in photoreceptor differentiation. Furthermore, this circadian regulation was maintained in adult retina. Thus, once mature photoreceptors are formed, multiple retinal transcription factors fall under circadian clock control, at which point they appear to play a new and important role in regulating rhythmic elements in the phototransduction pathway.",10.5061/dryad.r07bc,photoreceptors|neuroD|retina|transcription factors|zebrafish|circadian clock,"Centre for Cell and Molecular Dynamics, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London",Danio rerio,,2014-06-13,DRYAD,Data from: Transcription factors involved in retinogenesis are co-opted by the circadian clock following photoreceptor differentiation,,

In the past decade, nanoscale materials have made significant commercial impacts, which will potentially lead to the next industrial revolution. The interest lies in the novel and promising features nanoscale materials exhibit due to their confined sizes. However, not all novel behaviors are understood or controllable. Many uncontrollable parameters, e.g. defects and dangling bonds, are known to hinder the performance of nanodevices. Solutions to these problems rely on our understanding of fundamental elements in nanoscience: isolated individual nanostructures and their assemblies. ❧ In this dissertation, we will address atomistic foundations of several problems of technological importance in nanoscience. Specifically, three basic problems are discussed: (1) embrittlement of nanocrystalline metal; (2) novel thermo-mechanical behaviors of nanowires (NWs); and (3) planar defect generation in NWs. With a scalable algorithm implemented on massively parallel computing platforms and various data mining methods, MD simulations can provide valuable insights into these problems. ❧ An essential role of sulfur segregation-induced amorphization of crystalline nickel was recently discovered experimentally, but the atomistic mechanism of the amorphization remains unexplained. Our MD simulations reveal that the large steric size of sulfur impurity causes strong sulfur-sulfur interaction mediated by lattice distortion, which leads to amorphization near the percolation threshold at the sulfur-sulfur network in nickel crystal. The generality of the mechanism due to the percolation of an impurity network is further confirmed by a model binary system. ❧ In our study of novel behaviors of semiconductor NWs, MD simulations construct a rich size-temperature ‘phase diagram’ for the mechanical response of a zinc-oxide NW under tension. For smaller diameters and higher temperatures, novel transitions are found from brittle cleavage to structural transformation-mediated brittle cleavage to ductile failure. Atomistic mechanisms of the unique nano-thermo-mechanical behavior are elucidated as a consequence of surface-structural relaxation, which in particular predicts spontaneous formation of a core/shell structure under tension. The phase diagram resolves controversies between previous experiments and theory, and the predicted ‘intrinsic’ core/shell structure may find novel device applications. ❧ Generation of stacking faults (SFs) during the growth of NWs is a major concern for the efficiency of NW-based devices such as solar cells. MD simulation of a [111]-oriented gallium arsenide NW reveals an atomistic mechanism of SF generation. Spatial distribution of the adatom energy on the (111)B top surface exhibits a novel core/shell structure due to the contraction of atomic bonds at the sidewall surfaces, where SFs are preferentially nucleated in the shell. A nucleation growth model incorporating the core/shell mechanism suggests a size and growth-condition controlled approach for SF-free growth of NWs.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-219293,Materials Science|percolation|brittle-to-ductile transition|embrittlement|ZnO|phase transition|molecular dynamics|nanostructures|GaAs|selective area growth|twin|nanowire,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Molecular dynamics simulations of nanostructures,,

,"Li, Ying",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-458055,DATASET,,"This dissertation is focused on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of energetic materials. Energetic materials are a class of materials with high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released. Propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnic are typical classes of energetic materials. In the past decade, energetic materials have been playing very important roles in the fields of defense and other technologies, since they are secure, convenient and energetically compact, which will be continuously functionalized for further improvements indispensably in the new era. The significance of how to utilize the novel and promising features more profitably and constructively will necessitate fundamental understanding of dynamics of the material releasing energy through reactions. ❧ Among all kinds of energetic materials, aluminum nanostructures and high explosives are the subjects studied in this dissertation. For aluminum nanostructures, we have performed multimillion atom reactive MD simulations to investigate the oxidation dynamics of aluminum nanoparticles (Al-NPs), Al-NP aggregates, and aluminum nanorods (Al-NRs). For high explosives, we have addressed the shock‐induced detonation of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX, an initialism for Research Department Explosive). ❧ The scientific interest in aluminum nanostructures research basically lies in the increased reactivity during oxidation as compared with conventional micro‐sized structures. However, what is the size effect on the reactivities of the Al-NPs still puzzles researchers. Practically, Al-NPs commercially produced always have a thin oxide layer encapsulating the pure metal particles. The oxide shell has been included in all our simulated aluminum nanostructures to accurately represent the reality as much as possible. We have systematically simulated different sizes of single Al-NPs (diameter, D = 26, 36 and 46 nm) to study their reactivities in oxygen environments as isolated individuals. We have also systematically extended our study to their assemblies—Al-NP aggregates with different sizes in oxygen environments. Aluminum nanorods (Al-NRs), a different type of morphology, also have been investigated due to their high contact areas with oxidizers. Our MD simulations reveal, within the range of our studied cases, the smaller sizes of aluminum nanostructures have higher reactivities (e.g., faster reaction rate, shorter reaction time and faster oxidation speed). Meanwhile, our atomistic analyses show interesting and unexpected roles of the interfaces of the oxide shell with aluminum and oxygen environment during the initial oxidation. In addition, the processes of final product formation show the evolution of different major intermediate species. Such atomistic understanding of the interface, reaction pathways and the size effect should have profound impacts on the design of the efficient burning of intermolecular products. ❧ The second topic of this dissertation is the detonation of a high explosive, RDX. Despite many years of intense research, atomistic mechanisms underlying the reaction time and intermediate reaction products of detonating high explosives have been elusive. Our reactive MD simulations reveal a novel two‐stage reaction mechanism during the detonation of RDX crystal. Rapid production of N₂ and H₂O is followed by delayed production of CO molecules. We have found that further decomposition towards the final products is inhibited by the formation of large, metastable carbon‐ and oxygen‐rich clusters. Such atomistic understanding may pave a way toward rational design for detonation synthesis of materials.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-458055,Materials Science|computational materials science|computer science|physics|energetic materials,,,,2016-01-01,usc.dl,Molecular dynamics study of energetic materials,,

The algorithm is not communication intensive, which makes the program suitable for running even on loosely coupled cluster systems. Particular attention is paid to the practical aspects of analyzing the program output.

In previous studies it was found that K⁺ ions were allowed entrance into the channels' selectivity filter while Na⁺ ions were excluded from the selectivity filter at threonine 75. To determine ion selectivity in the bacterial K⁺-selective channel KcsA, mutational analysis was conducted on threonine 75 using molecular dynamics simulations. A step-wise pulling protocol was used to pull both K⁺ and Na⁺ ions through the wild type and mutant channels in order to estimate any changes of conductance or selectivity by the use of force profiles. Mutations were chosen specifically to investigate the importance of each of the side groups of threonine to selectivity. The three mutations studied changed threonine 75 to serine, valine or cysteine. In comparison to the wild type, both the valine and serine mutants excluded K⁺ and Na⁺ from entering into the selectivity filter while the cysteine mutant allowed both the K⁺ and Na⁺ ion to enter the selectivity filter. Interpretation of this data indicated that valine and serine mutants both decrease the conductance as well as the selectivity ratio of the KcsA channel. However, the cysteine mutant, which lost both methyl and hydroxyl groups, allows entry of both K⁺ and Na⁺ ions into the selectivity filter and may cause an increase in conductance as well as a decrease in the selectivity ratio. Results from molecular dynamics simulations help investigators to look at particle movement on a short temporal scale as well as helps make future experimental design more efficient. In future work, mutations will be inserted into KcsA DNA using PCR and conductance measurements will be taken using the patch clamp technique. These experiments will help determine mutational effects on selectivity and conductance of the actual ion channel.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-316791,step-wise pulling|sodium|potassium|ion channel|KcsA|ions|molecular dynamics|Physiology and Biophysics,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,KcsA: mutational analysis of ion selectivity with molecular dynamics,,

An unusual mechanism of positive cooperativity of monomeric GK containing only a single binding site for glucose is very interesting and still unclear. The activation process of GK is associated with a large-scale conformational change from the inactive to the active state. Here, conventional and targeted molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the conformational dynamics of GK in the stable configurations and in the transition from active to inactive state. Three phases of the structural reorganization of GK were detected. The first step is a transformation of GK from the active state to the intermediate structure, where the cleft between the domains is open, but alpha helix 13 is still inside the small domain. From this point, there are two alternative paths. One path leads to the inactive state through the release of helix 13 from the inside of small domain to the outside. Other path goes back to the active state. Simulation results reveal the critical role of helix 13 in the transformation of GK from the open state to inactive one and the influence of the loop 2 on the protein transformation between the open and the closed active states. Principal component analysis and covariance matrix analysis were carried out to analyze the dynamics of protein. Importance of hydrogen bonds in the stability of the closed conformation is shown.

 Nature of problem 
 Some phenomena involving defects take place inside three-dimensional crystals at times which can be hardly predicted. For this reason they are difficult to detect and track even within numerical experiments, especially when one is interested in studying their dynamical properties and time evolution. Furthermore, traditional simulation methods require the storage of a huge amount of data which in turn may imply a long work for their analysis.

An unusual mechanism of positive cooperativity of monomeric GK containing only a single binding site for glucose is very interesting and still unclear. The activation process of GK is associated with a large-scale conformational change from the inactive to the active state. Here, conventional and targeted molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the conformational dynamics of GK in the stable configurations and in the transition from active to inactive state. Three phases of the structural reorganization of GK were detected. The first step is a transformation of GK from the active state to the intermediate structure, where the cleft between the domains is open, but alpha helix 13 is still inside the small domain. From this point, there are two alternative paths. One path leads to the inactive state through the release of helix 13 from the inside of small domain to the outside. Other path goes back to the active state. Simulation results reveal the critical role of helix 13 in the transformation of GK from the open state to inactive one and the influence of the loop 2 on the protein transformation between the open and the closed active states. Principal component analysis and covariance matrix analysis were carried out to analyze the dynamics of protein. Importance of hydrogen bonds in the stability of the closed conformation is shown. Overall, our simulations provide new information about the dynamics of GK and its structural transformation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Abstract 
Here we present a program aimed at free-energy calculations in molecular systems. It consists of a series of routines that can be interfaced with the most popular classical molecular dynamics (MD) codes through a simple patching procedure. This leaves the possibility for the user to exploit many different MD engines depending on the system simulated and on the computational resources available. Free-energy calculations can be performed as a function of many collective variables, with a partic...

The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gsα. The results show that both ATP and Gsα binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gsα notably help to explain how Gsα binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release. Simulations also suggest a possible coupling between ATP binding and interactions with the inhibitory G-protein subunit Gαi.

All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the GROMACS 5 package. The simulations were carried out in an NTP ensemble at a temperature of 310 K and a pressure of 1 bar using a Bussi velocity-rescaling thermostat  (tT = 1 ps) and a Parrinello-Rahman barostat (tP = 1 ps).

,"Nijjar, Parmeet Kaur",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-121057,DATASET,,"Adiabatic as well as non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods are essential tools to simulate many important physical processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic information that often cannot be detected by experiment alone and also serve as a predictive tool to stimulate new research. However, sophisticated modeling of ultrafast processes, especially those involving excited states, is intellectually challenging and computationally demanding. The work presented here provides several diverse examples of challenging gas phase and condensed phase ultrafast photoinduced processes. For each system, we offer a detailed account of the computational modeling scheme employed for an accurate description of the chemical and physical properties of interest. At the same time, we highlight the limitations of the particular dynamics methods used. ❧ In Chapter 1, we start with an overview of the adiabatic and the non-adiabatic dynamics. This is followed by a description of the primary non-adiabatic dynamics methods, the Ehrenfest dynamics and the Fewest Switches Surface Hopping method. We also describe the major limitations of the two approaches, especially the neglect of decoherence effects among others. ❧ This is followed by an example of the application of adiabatic molecular dynamics in Chapter 2 to study the atomistic origin of room temperature coherence between the light-hole and heavy-hole excitations in two-dimensional CdSe and CdSe/CdZnS core/shell nanoplatelets, synthesized and studied recently by optical spectroscopy. The molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to mimic closely the experimental systems and measurements, and to elucidate the role of defects that are inevitably present in experiment. Chapter 3 provides another application of quantum-classical molecular dynamics to study the conversion of He(2³S) to He₂(a₃Σᵤ⁺) in large helium nanodroplets. He ⃰₂ is a likely participant in the production of He₄⁺ on surfaces of large helium droplets which shows an anomalously intense peak in mass spectra of large helium droplets. Ab initio molecular dynamics with highly accurate and robust equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theory, showed rapid and efficient conversion of He ⃰  to He ⃰₂ in systems composed of small numbers of Helium atoms. ❧ The Born-Oppenheimer dynamics is followed by the non-adiabatic dynamics with electronic transitions in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 analyzes the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm and brings attention to one of its limitations, the trivial crossing problem. It provides a comparison of the standard fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm with the Min-Cost adiabatic state identity tracking algorithm, which treats the trivial crossing problem of FSSH. The performance of the two methods is investigated for the internal conversion and energy transfer dynamics of a weakly coupled spiro-linked polyfluorene (spirobifluorene) system. The results reveal that FSSH fails to identify trivial crossings, therefore, the system remains on the upper adiabatic surface at such crossings and reaches the lowest excited state only via non-adiabatic transitions resulting in a longer relaxation time-scale as compared to the Min-Cost method. ❧ Chapter 5 addresses the other primary mixed quantum classical dynamics method, the Ehrenfest method. Ehrenfest method does not produce the Boltzmann equilibrium populations of the quantum states at a finite temperature. Additionally, both the Ehrenfest MD and the FSSH techniques are fully quantum coherent, they do not account for decoherence. In this chapter, we present a semiclassical approach for non-adiabatic molecular dynamics based on the Ehrenfest method with corrections for decoherence effects and detailed balance. The decoherence effects are described via a coherence penalty functional that drives dynamics away from regions in Hilbert space characterized by large values of coherences. Detailed balance is described by modification of the off-diagonal matrix elements with a quantum correction factor used in semiclassical approximations to quantum time-correlation functions. Both decoherence and detailed balance corrections introduce non-linear terms to the Schrodinger equation. At the same time, the simplicity of the Ehrenfest method, which involves fully deterministic dynamics and requires a single trajectory for each initial condition, is preserved. In contrast, surface hopping techniques contain stochastic elements and require averaging over multiple realizations of stochastic process for each initial condition. The method is applied to a hybrid nanoscale system consisting of a fluorophore molecule and an STM tip studied experimentally. By investigating current-induced charge injection, cooling, and recombination, we demonstrate that the Ehrenfest-decoherence-detailed-balance (Ehrenfest-DDB) method produces timescales that are similar to those obtained with the decoherence induced surface hopping (DISH), which is a popular nonadiabatic molecular dynamics technique used with many condensed matter and nanoscale systems. The Ehrenfest-DDB technique provides efficient means to study quantum dynamics in large, realistic systems. ❧ Finally, in chapter 6, we outline future directions and discuss further investigations of the developed computational scheme to establish the range of problems it can be applied to with useful accuracy.",10.25549/usctheses-c89-121057,fewest switches surface hopping|non-adiabatic dynamics|Ehrenfest method|decoherence|Boltzmann equilibrium|Chemistry (Chemical Physics)|adiabatic dynamics,,,,2019-01-01,usc.dl,Adiabatic and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics in nanoscale systems: theory and applications,,

Abstract 
A method to measure the phonon dispersion of a crystal based on molecular dynamics simulation is proposed and implemented as an extension to an open source classical molecular dynamics simulation code LAMMPS. In the proposed method, the dynamical matrix is constructed by observing the displacements of atoms during molecular dynamics simulation, making use of the fluctuation–dissipation theory. The dynamical matrix can then be employed to compute the phonon spectra by evaluating its eigenvalue...

In particular atomistic molecular dynamics provide an opportunity to model systems that are unobservable through conventional experimental methods as well as supplement understanding of observations. In this thesis molecular dynamics were applied to study biological cell membranes, specifically lipid bilayers, the primary constituent of the cell membrane, in electric fields, and to understand the mechanism and events associated with electroporation. Electroporation is a widely used experimental and commercial technique for introducing normally excluded compounds such as DNA, RNA, ions, drugs, and other chemicals into cells. Traditional electroporation utilizes kilovolt-per-meter electric fields applied on the order of microseconds that disrupt and scramble the cell membrane and allow diffusive entry, however, ultra-short nanosecond pulses at megavolt-per-meter fields produce different effects in cells which remain largely uncharacterized. One such effect, the migration of the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine from the inner to outer leaflet of the cell, is of particular biological interest because of its association with cell apoptosis, or programmable cell death. Control of such an event could be useful in developing a targeted treatment for removing unwanted cells such as tumors or melanoma. In this thesis I begin by introducing electroporation and its history and explain how molecular dynamics and its techniques can help advance our understanding of the field.

From simple studies of liquid argon in the 1960s to fully atomistic simulations of entire viruses in the past few years, recent advances in high-performance computing have continuously enabled simulations to bridge the gap between scientific theory and experiment. Molecular dynamics simulations in particular have allowed for the direct observation of spatial and temporal events which are at present inaccessible to experiments. For this dissertation I employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the transient, electric field-induced poration (or electroporation) of phospholipid bilayers at MV/m electric fields. ❧ Phospholipid bilayers are the dominant constituents of cell membranes and act as both a barrier and gatekeeper to the cell interior. This makes their structural integrity and susceptibility to external perturbations an important topic for study, especially as the density of electromagnetic radiation in our environment is increasing steadily. The primary goal of this dissertation is to understand the specific physical and biological mechanisms which facilitate electroporation, and to connect our simulated observations to experiments with live cells and to continuum models which seek to describe the underlying biological processes of electroporation. ❧ In Chapter 1 I begin with a brief introduction to phospholipids and phospholipid bilayers, followed by an extensive overview of electroporation and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The following chapters will then focus on peer-reviewed and published work we performed, or on existing projects which are currently being prepared for submission. Chapter 2 looks at how external electric fields affect both oxidized and unoxidized lipid bilayers as a function of oxidation concentration and oxidized lipid type. Oxidative damage to cell membranes represents a physiologically relevant system where lipids can become damaged or severely impacted from interacting with reactive oxygen species, and these events become more frequent with age. The results are then compared to experiments where we show agreement between our simulations, theoretical models, and experiments with peroxidized cells in our lab. In Chapter 3 I outline a set of unique metrics which can be used to quantitatively measure the life cycle of a discrete electropore for the first time, across multiple lipid species, and I compare these results to analytical models where we find good agreement with theory. In Chapter 4 I use the life cycle of an electropore as a tool to measure the effects of electrolyte and lipid headgroup charge on electroporation compared to electrolyte-free and zwitterionic systems, in addition to presenting ion binding isotherms to determine the validity of our simulated electrolyte models. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the roles of water and lipid respectively on electroporation using simplified water:vacuum systems, osmotic swelling simulations, systems at varying temperature, and systems where we successfully modulated the electropore radius using customized time-dependent electric fields. I conclude this dissertation with a brief summary of these studies followed by a short outlook on the future of electroporation simulations as a whole.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-280283,electrogenetherapy|electroperturbation|membrane|simulation|pulsed power|electrochemotherapy|membrane biology|molecular dynamics|lipid|Physics|membrane biophysics|electropermeabilization|physics|lipid bilayer|electroporation|DNA transfection|phospholipid|biophysics,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Theoretical studies of lipid bilayer electroporation using molecular dynamics simulations,,

However, the analysis of trajectories for relevant but rare events, such as a jump of the diffusing mobile ion, is still rather cumbersome, requiring prior knowledge of the diffusive process in order to get meaningful results. In this work we present a novel approach to detect the relevant events in a diffusive system without assuming prior information regarding the underlying process. We start from a projection of the atomic coordinates into a landmark basis to identify the dominant features in a mobile ion's environment. Subsequent clustering in landmark space enables a discretization of any trajectory into a sequence of distinct states. As a final step, the use of the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptor allows distinguishing between different environments in a straightforward way.

Determining the intrinsic mechanical properties of the individual transmembrane helices is therefore central to understanding the intricacies of the gating mechanism of MS channels. We used a constant-force steered molecular dynamics (SMD) approach to perform unidirectional pulling tests on all the helices of MscL in M. tuberculosis and E. coli homologs. Using this method, we could overcome the issues encountered with the commonly used constant-velocity SMD simulations, such as low mechanical stability of the helix during stretching and high dependency of the elastic properties on the pulling rate. We estimated Young's moduli of the α-helices of MscL to vary between 0.2 and 12.5 GPa with TM2 helix being the stiffest. We also studied the effect of water on the properties of the pore-lining TM1 helix. In the absence of water, this helix exhibited a much stiffer response.

The main code is based on the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm in various variants, including the powerful multilayer-MCTDH algorithm that has been used to propagate a wavefunction for up to 1000 degrees of freedom. MCTDH uses a contraction of traditional discrete basis set representations of the Hamiltonian and wavefunction, and Quantics includes a range of variable representation (DVR) grid basis sets and collocation methods. Input is via ascii text files and for molecules with analytical potential functions no programming is required. A library of potential functions is included to treat more complicated cases, and more functions can be added as required by the user. The code also includes the variational multi-configurational Gaussian (vMCG) method that is based on a Gaussian wavepacket expansion of the wavefunction. vMCG can be run in a “direct” manner (DD-vMCG), calculating the potential energy surfaces on-the-fly using a number of quantum chemistry programs. In addition to wavepacket propagation, Quantics can solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for small systems and can solve the Liouville–von-Neumann equation to propagate density matrices. The Package includes auxiliary programs to help set up calculations and analyse the output.

Computer simulation is used to investigate the aggregation problem. An intermediate‐resolution coarse‐grained model of proteins as well as a high‐resolution all‐atom model of proteins are employed together with discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD). This combination is approved to be fast and accurate to simulate the aggregation process of multiple‐protein systems. ❧ We first investigate the aggregation of multiple polyalanine peptides in unbounded media. Different numbers of identical polyalanine peptides are simulated to mimic β‐amyloid aggregation in bulk solutions. In all cases we observe fibril‐like aggregates, which have been implicated in many neuro‐degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion. Various properties of the aggregates have been computed, including dynamic evolution of the total number of aggregates, mean aggregate size, number of the peptides that contribute to the formation of β‐sheets, number of various types of hydrogen bonds formed in the systems, radius of gyration of the aggregates, and diffusivity of the aggregates. These results show that the aggregation process follows a nucleation scenario, which is also observed in experiments. Many of the quantities follow dynamic scaling, similar to those found in the aggregation of colloidal clusters. In particular, at long times the mean aggregate size S(t) grows with time as S(t)∼tᶻ, where z is the dynamic exponent. The existence of such dynamic scaling was recently confirmed by experiments. ❧ Next, we investigate the aggregation of the same polyalanine peptides but in confined environments. The medium, as a model of a crowded cellular environment, is represented by a spherical cavity, as well as cylindrical tubes with two aspect ratios. The aggregation process leads to the formation of β‐sheets and eventually fibrils. Several important properties of the aggregation process, including dynamic evolution of the total number of aggregates, mean aggregate size, and number of peptides that contribute to the formation of β‐sheets, have been computed. We show, similar to the unconfined media, that the computed properties follow dynamic scaling, characterized by power laws. The exponents that characterize the power‐law in spherical cavities are shown to agree with those in unbounded media in the same protein density, while the exponents for the aggregation in cylindrical tubes exhibit sensitivity to the geometry of the system. The effects on aggregation from the protein size, i.e. the number of amino acids in a protein, as well as the size of the confined media, have also been studied. Similarities and differences between the aggregations in confined and unconfined media are described. ❧ Last, we use DMD combined with an all‐atom model of proteins to investigate the aggregation of poly‐glycine‐alanine in unbounded media. The simulation shows poly‐glycine‐alanine is an aggregation‐prone protein and will eventually form β‐sheet‐rich aggregates, which matches the experiment observations. Dynamic evolution of the total number of aggregates has been calculated. In the simulations, we observe two unique helical structures, β‐helix and double‐helix, frequently form in different configurations. We investigate their structures in detail and the analysis results show that such helical structures are very stable and share the characteristics of both α‐helix and β‐sheet. Identical phenomena are also observed in poly‐glycine‐arginine systems. We propose that proteins having the sequence of (GX)ₙ, where X could be any non‐glycine amino acid and n is the repeat length, would share the same folding structures of β‐helix and double‐helix, and it is the glycine in the repeat that contributes to this characteristic.",10.25549/usctheses-c89-76032,protein aggregation|Chemical Engineering|molecular dynamics|confined media|dynamic scaling,,,,2018-01-01,usc.dl,Molecular dynamics studies of protein aggregation in unbounded and confined media,,

However, the service life of these materials is often limited due to the formation of cracks and defects that leads to their eventual failure, thus insights into atomistic mechanisms underlying these processes are valuable inputs for the design of next-generation nanostructured materials. In this research work, large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, combined with machine learning and data mining techniques is used to understand three basic problems related to nanostructured materials design with superior mechanical properties, which are: (1) ultra-light material design using hierarchical structures like kagomé lattices, (2) self-healing of cracks in alumina composite embedded with SiC/SiO₂ nanoparticles, and (3) toughing of MoWSe₂ monolayer during crack propagation by novel strain-induced structural phase transformation. ❧ Many natural and man-made materials exhibit hierarchical structures like for example bird wings, Eiffel tower, Garabit Viaduct. This hierarchy in structures can be used for materials design at the atomic level as it allows us to tune several materials properties like stiffness, compressive strength, fracture toughness by just changing the underlying structural arrangement of materials. In the first work, we have studied the deformation behavior of an ultralight architecture consisting of hollow Ni nanotubes and solid nanorods arranged as a 3-D kagomé structure. Our result shows that hollow kagomé structure have higher strength and stiffness in comparison of solid kagomé structures. The hollow kagomé structure shows two stage deformation mechanism where up to 11% strain, deformation is highly localized near the nodal region and at higher strain they show bending-dominated deformation. Whereas in solid kagomé structures, large defamations are observed in the entire structure even at lower strain. ❧ Designing material systems that can sense and repair damage is of great interest. Inspired by biological systems, material scientists are developing self-healing materials in which damage initiation triggers an automatic release and transport of healing agent to the damage site and repairs it. In the second work, we have investigated crack healing in a ceramic nanocomposite of alumina containing SiC/SiO₂ nanoparticles. Our result shows that the nanoparticles closest to the advancing crack in alumina distort to create nanochannels through which silica flows toward the crack and heals the damage. Under applied strain, alumina matrix also forms facets at interfaces. These facets act as nucleation sites for multiple secondary amorphous grains in alumina matrix. Nanovoids form along the grain boundaries but these nanovoids are again healed by molten silica released from the nanoparticles. The mechanisms of crack healing in alumina will help experimentalists to design novel self-healing ceramics for a broad class of energy technologies. ❧ Two-dimensional materials exhibit different mechanical property in comparison of their bulk counterpart owing to their monolayer atomic thickness. In fact, properties of these layered materials can be tuned by mechanical deformation. In the third work, we have examined the atomistic mechanisms of defect formation and crack propagation in a strained monolayer MoWSe₂ alloy using molecular dynamics. Our result shows that under strain, the crack meanders as it propagates through the system and branches into daughter cracks when it crosses the MoSe₂/WSe₂ interface and enters the WSe₂ patches. The most dramatic change occurs in the process zone around the crack tip, where large stress concentration and the resulting biaxial tensile strain trigger an irreversible local structural phase transformation from the ground state 2H crystal structure to the 1T crystal structure. This phenomenon of crack branching, crack closure and strain induced phase transformation in MoWSe₂ alloy increases its fracture toughness.",10.25549/usctheses-c89-80832,kagome lattices|strain-induced phase transition|Materials Science|hierarchical meta-materials|ceramic nano-composite|grain-growth|micro-architectured material|reactive molecular dynamics|self-healing ceramics|layered material|neural network,,,,2018-01-01,usc.dl,Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of nano-structured materials,,

Each topology file was created listing all possible bonded interactions including bonds, bond angles and dihedrals. Improper dihedrals were treated using harmonic potential. For each atom, non-bonded inter- and intra-molecular interactions were identified within the OPLS-AA library.

The topology files, and the accuracy of the OPLS-AA force field, were validated by comparing the MD calculations of bulk density and dynamic viscosity with experimental values, resulting in excellent agreement. The bulk density was evaluated using the Gromacs tool, gmx energy, whereas viscosities were evaluated using gmx tcaf, which estimates it from autocorrelation functions of the transverse currents.

This dependence on the connectivity of the cellular network introduces several complications to performing molecular-dynamics-like simulations of vertex models, and in particular makes parallelizing the simulations difficult. cellGPU addresses this difficulty and lays the foundation for massively parallelized, GPU-based simulations of these models. This article discusses its implementation for a pair of two-dimensional models, and compares the typical performance that can be expected between running cellGPU entirely on the CPU versus its performance when running on a range of commercial and server-grade graphics cards. By implementing the calculation of topological changes and forces on cells in a highly parallelizable fashion, cellGPU enables researchers to simulate time- and length-scales previously inaccessible via existing single-threaded CPU implementations.",10.17632/6j2cj29t3r.1,Computational Physics|Molecular Dynamics,,Computational Physics|Molecular Dynamics,,2017-06-15,MENDELEY_DATA,cellGPU: Massively parallel simulations of dynamic vertex models,article,1

Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory.

As researchers around the world are trying to expand the current understanding of the behavior of materials at the atomistic scale, the limited resolution of equipment, both in terms of time and space, act as roadblocks to a comprehensive study. Numerical methods, in general and molecular dynamics, in particular act as able compliment to the experiments in our quest for understanding material behavior. In this research work, large scale molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the mechano-chemical behavior under extreme conditions of a variety of systems with many real world applications. The body of this work is divided into three parts, each covering a particular system: ❧ 1) Aggregates of aluminum nanoparticles are good solid fuel due to high flame propagation rates. Multi-million atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism underlying higher reaction rate in a chain of aluminum nanoparticles as compared to an isolated nanoparticle. This is due to the penetration of hot atoms from reacting nanoparticles to an adjacent, unreacted nanoparticle, which brings in external heat and initiates exothermic oxidation reactions. ❧ 2) Cavitation bubbles readily occur in fluids subjected to rapid changes in pressure. We use billion-atom reactive molecular dynamics simulations on a 163,840-processor BlueGene/P supercomputer to investigate chemical and mechanical damages caused by shock-induced collapse of nanobubbles in water near amorphous silica. Collapse of an empty nanobubble generates high-speed nanojet, resulting in the formation of a pit on the surface. The pit contains a large number of silanol groups and its volume is found to be directly proportional to the volume of the nanobubble. The gas-filled bubbles undergo partial collapse and consequently the damage on the silica surface is mitigated. ❧ 3) The structure and dynamics of water confined in nanoporous silica are different from that of bulk water, and insight into the properties of confined water is important for our understanding of many geological and biological processes. Nanoporous silica has a wide range of technological applications because it is easy to tune the size of pores and their morphologies and to functionalize pore surfaces with a variety of molecular moieties. Nanoporous silica is used in catalysis, chromatography, anticorrosion coatings, desalination membranes, and as drug delivery vehicles.

Our study focused on understanding the crystal structure of Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (PDB ID:5ZDO) and mechanism of formation of enzyme–substrate complex using substrates and its analogs by applying molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) to investigate the conformational changes. Least energy structure of TtGlnRS was considered to dock the enzyme substrates such as glutamine (Gln), glutamic acid (Glu), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), QSI and various substrate analogs (2MA, 4SU and 5MU) onto the active site of the enzyme. We focused on comparative analysis of binding specificity between Gln and Glu; similarly, ATP and AMP.

,
 In short, the protein model and solvent system (TIP3P, ~12k atoms, CHARMM36 [Huang &amp; MacKerell, 2013]) once built was minimized (500 steps), slowly heated to 298K (0.01K/fs), and then simulated for 2 ns at constant volume twice: first with a 10 kJ/mol/Å2 harmonic restraint on each protein atom and then without restraints. The resulting system was equilibrated for 100 ns at constant pressure (1 atm). All manipulation and calculations were performed using VMD 1.9.2 [Humphrey, et al., 1996] and NAMD 2.11 [Phillips, et al., 2005].

There are several drug targets which are reported to control the severe level of AD; notably, acetylcholinesterase, β-Secretase and glycogen synthase kinase enzymes are approached as a good drug targets for AD. Hence, the present study mainly focused to discover newly synthesized molecule (7-propyl-6H-pyrano[3,2-c:5,6-c']dichromene-6,8(7H)-dione) as a potential triplet acting drug for above said enzymes through the analysis of X-ray crystallography, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculation. The target drug molecule was crystallized in the monoclinic crystal structure with P21/n space group. The structure was solved by SHELXS and refined by SHELXL. The crystal packing is stabilized by C − H···O type of interactions. Further, the induced fit docking shows that the molecule has high docking score, glide energy, favorable hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions on the protein targets. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed to understand the stability of the molecule in the presence of active site environment. Finally, quantum chemical calculation has been carried out for the molecule in gas phase and for the corresponding molecule lifted from the active site region.

Peb4 gene deletion alters the outer membrane protein profile and impairs cellular adhesion and biofilm formation for C. jejuni. Earlier crystallographic study has proposed that the PPIase domains are flexible and might form a cradle for holding the substrate and these aspects of Peb4 were explored using sub-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations in solution environment. Our simulations have revealed that PPIase domains are highly flexible and undergo a large structural change where they move apart from each other by 8 nm starting at .5 nm. Further, this large conformational change renders Peb4 as a compact protein with crossed-over conformation, forms a central cavity, which can “cradle” the target substrate. As reported for other chaperone proteins, flexibility of linker region connecting the chaperone and PPIase domains is key to forming the “crossed-over” conformation. The conformational transition of the Peb4 protein from the X-ray structure to the crossed-over conformation follows the “mother’s arms” chain model proposed for the FkpA chaperone protein.

When designing this application, the emphasis was placed on ease of use as well as ease of further development.

There are several drug targets which are reported to control the severe level of AD; notably, acetylcholinesterase, β-Secretase and glycogen synthase kinase enzymes are approached as a good drug targets for AD. Hence, the present study mainly focused to discover newly synthesized molecule (7-propyl-6H-pyrano[3,2-c:5,6-c']dichromene-6,8(7H)-dione) as a potential triplet acting drug for above said enzymes through the analysis of X-ray crystallography, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculation. The target drug molecule was crystallized in the monoclinic crystal structure with P21/n space group. The structure was solved by SHELXS and refined by SHELXL. The crystal packing is stabilized by C − H···O type of interactions. Further, the induced fit docking shows that the molecule has high docking score, glide energy, favorable hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions on the protein targets. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed to understand the stability of the molecule in the presence of active site environment. Finally, quantum chemical calculation has been carried out for the molecule in gas phase and for the corresponding molecule lifted from the active site region. The structural comparison between gas phase and active site helps to understand the conformational modification of the molecule in the active site. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Abstract of the paper:
This work elucidates the dependence of operating stress of persistent slip bands (PSB) on the channel width and wall dislocation density.  Using Cu as a model system and molecular dynamics as the main investigative tool, a new length scale effect, namely the wall dislocation spacing, is provided to enhance theoretical understanding of PSBs.  It is discovered that the operation of PSB is a thermally activated event in which operating stress is inversely related to the wall dislocation spacing, strain rate and temperature.  Leveraging the existing framework of confined layer slip in nanoscale metallic multilayers and classical nucleation theory, a mathematical model describing the rate- and temperature- dependent PSB operating stress is proposed.

Abstract 
Massively parallel computers now permit the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of multi-million atom systems on time scales up to the microsecond. However, the subsequent analysis of the resulting simulation trajectories has now become a high performance computing problem in itself. Here, we present software for calculating X-ray and neutron scattering intensities from MD simulation data that scales well on massively parallel supercomputers. The calculation and data staging schemes used maxim...

Nature of problem 
Recent developments in supercomputing allow molecular dynamics simulations to generate large trajectories spanning millions of frames and thousands of atoms. The structural and dynamical analysis of these trajectories requires analysis algorithms which use parallel computation and IO schemes to solve the computational task in a practical amount of time. The particular computational and IO requirements very much depend on the particular analysis algorithm. In scattering calculations a very freque ...

The key significance for the S4 motion is to drive the gate located in the pore domain of the channels opening or closing in respond to changes in the membrane potential. The molecular mechanism of voltage-dependent conformational transition of VSD is not clearly understood. Unfortunately, crystal structures of a number of voltage-gated ion channels including Kv1.2, KvAP, NavAb and NavRh, could represent the voltage sensor in an only one state so-called “Up” or activated conformation. In this thesis, a computational study of the activated (Up) and resting (Down) conformations of the isolated VSD from the prokaryotic K+ channel KvAP is presented. The Down sensor model was developed based on the PaDSAR approach, molecular dynamics simulations and solvent continuum gating charge calculations. The results show that KvAP-VSD transforms from the resting to activated conformations by an upward tilt and slide of the S4 helix to the upper face of membrane bilayer with a distance of 3-5Å. This motion was associated with the movement of gating charge arginines and a change in salt-bridge arginines, giving rise to an increase of water penetration into the voltage sensor core. The reorientation of helical dipoles on S4 and a change in the internal dielectric constant of VSD should involve with the voltage-sensing mechanism. Comparison of the simulations with and without external electric fields revealed that the presence of membrane potential helps to stabilize the Down conformation of KvAP-VSD. The gating charge for the models was calculated to be 2.82±0.09e per monomer. This is in good agreement with the experimental estimates of 12–14e measured for the Shaker K+ tetrameric channel.",10.14457/cu.the.2012.295,Membranes (Biology)|Molecular dynamics|เมมเบรน (ชีววิทยา)|พลศาสตร์เชิงโมเลกุล,,,,2012-01-01,nrct.db1,Structural and dynamical properties of voltage sensor domain of activated and resting potassium channel in lipid bilayer by molecular dynamics simulation,,

Spin–lattice dynamics simulates the collective time evolution of spins and atoms, taking into account the effect of non-collinear magnetism on interatomic forces. Applications of the method include atomistic models for defects, dislocations and surfaces in magnetic materials, thermally activated diffusion of defects, magnetic phase transitions, and various magnetic and lattice relaxation phenomena. Spin–lattice dynamics retains all the capabilities of molecular dynamics, adding to them the treatment of non-collinear magnetic degrees of freedom. The spin–lattice dynamics time integration algorithm uses symplectic Suzuki–Trotter decomposition of atomic coordinate, velocity and spin evolution operators, and delivers highly accurate numerical solutions of dynamic evolution equations over extended intervals of time. The code is parallelized in coordinate and spin spaces, and is written in OpenMP C/C++ for CPU and in CUDA C/C++ for Nvidia GPU implementations. Temperatures of atoms and spins are controlled by Langevin thermostats. Conduction electrons are treated by coupling the discrete spin–lattice dynamics equations for atoms and spins to the heat transfer equation for the electrons. Worked examples include simulations of thermalization of ferromagnetic bcc iron, the dynamics of laser pulse demagnetization, and collision cascades.",10.17632/x3nyy26fp3.1,Natural Sciences,,Natural Sciences,,2016-09-16,MENDELEY_DATA,SPILADY: A Parallel CPU and GPU Code for Spin-Lattice Magnetic Molecular Dynamics Simulations,article,1

Approximately two million deaths result annually from bacterial infections worldwide. Therefore, there is a paramount requirement to develop innovative and novel antibacterial agents with new mechanisms of action and activity against resistant bacterial strains. For this purpose, a set of benzothiazole and N-phenylpyrrolamides derivatives reported as DNA Gyrase B (GyrB) inhibitors were collected from the literature and docked inside the receptor cavity of DNA Gyrase B (PDB ID: 5L3J). The best 10 docked complexes were used to identify novel antibacterial chemical agents through a de novo design approach. Out of initial 300 chemical analogues, the best six analogues were identified using screening with a set of criteria followed by pharmacokinetic analysis. The binding interactions of the best six analogues revealed that all molecules formed a number of critical interactions with catalytic amino residues of DNA Gyrase B with high binding energy. The predicted inhibitory constant biological activity based on binding energy supported the potential of the molecules as DNA Gyrase B ligands. The RMSD, RMSF, and radius of gyration parameters obtained from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation study clearly demonstrated that all six analogues were efficient enough to form stable complexes with DNA Gyrase B. High negative binding energy of all ligands obtained from MM-GBSA approach undoubtedly explained the strong affinity toward the DNA Gyrase B. Therefore, the proposed de novo designed molecules can be considered as promising antibacterial chemical agents subject to experimental validation, in vitro. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The network approach clearly identifies the sites restructuring upon photo-activation, which appear as protrusions or delicate bridges in the reorganisation network. We also find that, unlike in the homologous cryptochrome from D. melanogaster, the release of the C-terminal domain does not appear to be correlated with the transposition of a histidine residue close to the FAD cofactor.,Exemplary NAMD input, parameter and output files for the radical pair sate (RPD) of cryptochrome 4 from E. rebecula (European robin), including a 100 ns MD trajectory of the protein (solvent removed from the original output).,The article associated with this dataset is located in ORE at: http://hdl.handle.net/10871/35086,",10.24378/exe.363,photo-activation|cryptochrome 4|E. rubecula|radical pair|European Robin|molecular dynamics,,,,2018-01-01,bl.exeter,Molecular dynamics simulations disclose early stages of the photo-activation of cryptochrome 4 (dataset),,

ZIF-78 is a promising material for the separation of CO₂ from a gas mixture. In this work, the molecular behavior of CO₂ and CH₄ in ZIF-78 as well as the adsorption selectivity and diffusion selectivity of CO₂ in CO₂/CH₄ mixtures were investigated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The RDF results show that the CO₂ is strongly adsorbed at O atoms of the –NO₂ group of ZIF-78 whereas the CH₄ is mostly observed at H atoms of the nitroimidazolate linker of ZIF-78, respectively. The self diffusivity of CO₂ does not depend on the concentration but it is the case for CH₄. From both kinds of selectivity, the significantly higher of adsorption selectivity (8.08) than diffusion selectivity (~0.3) indicates the main contribution of adsorption selectivity in membrane permeability.

In this study, by means of virtual screening, ADMET prediction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations techniques, one compound-ASN15761007 with high binding score, low toxicity were gained. It was observed by MD simulations that ASN15761007 not only possessed the same function as AZ242 did in activating PPARα and BRL did in activating PPARγ, but also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors.

To accelerate the discovery of PPAR α/γ dual agonists, the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) were performed for PPARα and PPARγ, respectively. Based on the molecular alignment, highly predictive CoMFA model for PPARα was obtained with a cross-validated q2 value of 0.741 and a conventional r2 of 0.975 in the non-cross-validated partial least-squares (PLS) analysis, while the CoMFA model for PPARγ with a better predictive ability was shown with q2 and r2 values of 0.557 and 0.996, respectively. Contour maps derived from the 3D-QSAR models provided information on main factors towards the activity. Then, we carried out structural optimization and designed several new compounds to improve the predicted biological activity. To investigate the binding modes of the predicted compounds in the active site of PPARα/γ, a molecular docking simulation was carried out. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicated that the predicted ligands were stable in the active site of PPARα/γ. Therefore, combination of the CoMFA and structure-based drug design results could be used for further structural alteration and synthesis and development of novel and potent dual agonists.

The simulations are based on experimentally validated interatomic potentials and employ highly efficiently algorithms for parallel architectures.; The onset of void-void interaction is investigated by performing MD simulations of amorphous silica under hydrostatic tension. The simulations reveal that nanocavities in amorphous silica (a-SiO2), which are linked to Si-O rings, play an important role in void-void coalescence and inter-void ligament failure.; Nanocracks nucleated by the migration of three-fold coordinated Si and nonbridging O on --Si-O-Si-O-- rings are observed in the multimillion MD simulations of a single void in amorphous silica subjected to a high shear rate. With the increase in shear strain, nanocracks appear on void surfaces and the voids deform into a threadlike structure. At a strain of 40%, the voids break into fragments. The results are similar to experimental and theoretical studies of bubble deformation and breakup under shear.; Defects such as voids are known to be important in the detonation of energetic materials. To investigate deformation of a void in an RDX crystal under high shear rate, we have performed million-atom reactive force field (ReaxFF) MD simulations. Simulations reveal that without breaking a bond, the excess strain energy leads to translational and rotational motion of RDX molecules. At a strain of 13%, molecules with high kinetic energy collapse inward without affecting the rest of the system.; MD simulations of nanoindentation in amorphous silica reveal migration of defects and their recombination in the densified plastic region under and the material pileup region around the indenter. The plastic flow of silica glass is related to the defect transport mechanism where a defect migrates a considerable distance via a chain of bond-switching events[44]. We obtained a hardness value of 7.2 GPa using a sharp indenter and 8.0 GPa for a slightly blunt indenter.; We have also performed nanoindentation simulation on a (100) á-RDX crystal surface using ReaxFF. Simulation reveals localized melting and decomposition of RDX molecular fragments. We have found a distinct (210) plane boundary, where molecules above the (210) plane have displaced dramatically and molecules below the plane remain intact. Simulation also shows the fragmented RDX molecules diffuse from the substrate and walk on the indenter surface.",10.25549/usctheses-m1464,damage|deformation|Physics|nonoidentation|fracture,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,"Multimillion-to-billion atom molecular dynamics simulations of deformation, damage, nanoindentation, and fracture in silica glass and energetic materials",,

Oseltamivir, the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor blocking the releasing of new viruses, is an effective agent against influenza B virus, however, the oseltamivir resistances conferring the E119G, R152K and D198N substitutions have been reported. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the wild-type and the three NA mutants with oseltamivir bound. Based on three different of MD simulations, the wild-type system is the most stability which oseltamivir strongly binds through the five key residues E119, D151, R152, R292 and R371. The notable loss of hydrogen bond and the decrease in per-residue decomposition energy at the mutated residues G119 and K152 compared to those of the wild-type were found to be the primary source of high-level oseltamivir resistance in the E119G and R152K mutants, respectively. In addition, the larger cavities in the NA active site conferring with these two mutations at the –NH3+ and –NHAc side chains, respectively, were compensated by more accessibility of water molecules. In contrast to the low level oseltamvir resistance in D198N mutant, this strain only showed slightly decreased in hydrogen bonds. According to the MM/PBSA binding free energies, the order of oseltamivir efficiency is of wild-type &gt; D198N &gt; E119G &gt; R152K in good agreement with the experimental IC50 values.",10.14457/cu.the.2011.178,การดื้อยา|Influenza|Drug resistance|ไข้หวัดใหญ่,,,,2011-01-01,nrct.db1,Oseltamivir efficiency toward neuraminidase of mutant strains of influenza b virus using molecular dynamics simulations,,

In this work, PET in flavodoxin from Desulfobivrio vulgaris, strain Miyazaki F (FD-DvMF) and from Helicobacter pylori (FD-HP), in which both bind one molecule of FMN as a cofactor, were studied using several molecular modeling techniques. Four FD-DvMF structures (wild type, W59F, Y97F and W59F-Y97F) were generated by homology modeling while the wild type structure of FD-HP was taken from the protein data bank. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of all five systems were carried out to investigate FMN-enzyme binding interaction as well as their dynamic properties. The decomposition free energy calculations indicate that the 10-loop region has the highest contribution to the binding, which is due to the H-bonding between phosphate subsite and amino acids. Ensemble of conformations obtained from the MD simulations of the five systems was supplied into the Kakitani and Mataga theory to analyze the PET mechanisms by fitting with experimental fluorescence quenching data. It was found that the mean electron transfer rate from Trp59 to excited Iso (Iso*) in the wild type was the fastest among the four FD-DvMF and it is from Tyr92 to Iso* for the FD-HP. In addition, the net electrostatic energy and the standard free energy change of the reaction are the most influential factors for the ultrafast electron transfer rate. The charge transfer (CT) was further studied by using quantum chemistry method. The calculations reveal that the state is the locally excited state while the S₂ state shows CT state characteristic.",10.14457/cu.the.2012.820,การเคลื่อนตัวของอิเล็กตรอน|ฟลาโวดอกซิน|พลศาสตร์เชิงโมเลกุล -- การจำลองระบบ|Electron mobility|ฟลาโวโปรตีน|Flavodoxin|Flavoproteins|Molecular dynamics -- Simulation methods,,,,2012-01-01,nrct.db1,Theoretical investigation of photoinduced electron transfer in flavodoxin from molecular dynamics simulation data,,

However, the exact mechanism/s underlying its biological effects are unknown. It has been previously shown that EGCG is capable of binding to and disrupting the membrane, so that some of its effects on biological systems could be ascribed to its capacity to incorporate into the biological membrane and modulate its structure. In this work, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) to discern the location and orientation of EGCG in model membranes and the possible existence of specific interactions with membrane lipids. For that goal, we have used in our simulation two complex model membranes, one resembling the plasma membrane (PM) and the other one the late endosome (LE) membrane. Our results support that EGCG tends to associate with the membrane and exists inside it in a relatively stable and steady location with a low propensity to be associated with other EGCG molecules. Interestingly, EGCG forms hydrogen bonds with POPC and POPE in the PM system but POPC and BMP and no POPE in the LE. These data suggest that the broad beneficial effects of EGCG could be mediated, at least in part, through its membranotropic effects and therefore membrane functioning. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Abstract 
Recent developments in path integral methodology have significantly reduced the computational expense of including quantum mechanical effects in the nuclear motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques...

The NBEs of ligands’ substructures vis-à-vis active site indicated that pyridyl fragment (F2B4) in L7G and L8G, and amide fragment (F2B5) in LAR and L6G are in high energy states. Based on ligands’ substructures and active site residues properties new compounds were designed by introducing phenolic and amidine moieties, respectively, for F2B4 and F2B5. This improved NBEs of new compounds (NC2, –60.93 kcal/mol; NC3, -42.42 kcal/mol). Also, Zn2+ group (substructure F1) of largazoles was modified with that of SAHA and Trapoxin A. Here, the results indicated in favor of Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A. New compound NC6 incorporating aforesaid modifications i.e. phenolic moiety for F2B4, amidine moiety for F2B5 and Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A in F1, offered best interactions with HDAC8 (–89.75 kcal/mol).

Since the cases of delamination of the coating take place in dental practice, it is very important to estimate the adhesive strength of HAp with the implant. A measure of the coating-to-substrate bond strength is the energy of this bond. In this research, quantum chemistry is used to calculate the binding energy of functional groups (anions) of hydroxyapatite and titanium 2+, which is a standard implant material. First, using Density Functional Theory with Becke three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr hybrid exchange-correlation functional, the lowest potential energy surface is calculated.

Apoptotic dysregulation can result in numerous pathological conditions, such as cancers, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegeneration. Members of the BCL-2 family of proteins regulate the process of apoptosis by its promotion or inhibition and overexpression of the pro-survival anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) has been associated with tumor maintenance, growth and progression Small molecules and peptides which bind the BH3 binding groove of these proteins have been explored in the recent times for their anticancer potential. The first anticancer agents targeting this family of proteins were aimed primarily toward inhibition of Bcl-2. An elevated level of Mcl-1, despite Bcl-2 inhibition, continues to be a cause for resistance in most cancers. However, in silico exploration of Mcl-1 specific drugs and their associated mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. In order to understand the same, we have carried out docking and molecular dynamic simulations on ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally active inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w proteins; Obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor as well as Maritoclax, an Mcl-1 specific inhibitor. Docking studies revealed that binding to the hydrophobic grooves is a prerequisite for action on the BCL protein and the binding mechanism and chemical space utilization dictates stability as well as specificity of the inhibitor molecular dynamic simulations showed that on binding, the α-helices of these proteins exhibited less fluctuations than loop regions, also hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding were observed to be the predominant interactions in the drug-receptor complexes.

However, the exact mechanism/s underlying its biological effects are unknown. It has been previously shown that EGCG is capable of binding to and disrupting the membrane, so that some of its effects on biological systems could be ascribed to its capacity to incorporate into the biological membrane and modulate its structure. In this work, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) to discern the location and orientation of EGCG in model membranes and the possible existence of specific interactions with membrane lipids. For that goal, we have used in our simulation two complex model membranes, one resembling the plasma membrane (PM) and the other one the late endosome (LE) membrane. Our results support that EGCG tends to associate with the membrane and exists inside it in a relatively stable and steady location with a low propensity to be associated with other EGCG molecules. Interestingly, EGCG forms hydrogen bonds with POPC and POPE in the PM system but POPC and BMP and no POPE in the LE. These data suggest that the broad beneficial effects of EGCG could be mediated, at least in part, through its membranotropic effects and therefore membrane functioning. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The DOX in both complexes was also observed to form the aromatic stacking interaction with the SWCNT surface. Interestingly, the DOX in the DOXin-SWCNT and DOXout-SWCNT complexes were found to move from one end to the other of the SWCNT, parallel to the tube surface at the distance (from the center of mass of the drug to the tube surface) of 4.5 Å and 4.0 Å, respectively.

Under these conditions we analyse liquid water's local structure and compare it with hexagonal ice. A spherical cut-off is used to collect nearest neighbours of oxygen atoms in the first coordination shell. Local orientational order parameters are then used to characterise the orientation in oxygen and hydrogen atoms in these molecules. At 1 and 1000 bar liquid water which is mostly 4 and 5 coordinated at 280 K becomes 4 coordinated when sufficieintly cooled. Oxygen atoms become more orientationally ordered with cooling and at temperatures less than 230 K its orientation is ice-like. Hydrogens tend to orient out-of-plane with cooling thus allowing the 4 coordinated water to form network like structures.

To accelerate the discovery of PPAR α/γ dual agonists, the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) were performed for PPARα and PPARγ, respectively. Based on the molecular alignment, highly predictive CoMFA model for PPARα was obtained with a cross-validated q2 value of 0.741 and a conventional r2 of 0.975 in the non-cross-validated partial least-squares (PLS) analysis, while the CoMFA model for PPARγ with a better predictive ability was shown with q2 and r2 values of 0.557 and 0.996, respectively. Contour maps derived from the 3D-QSAR models provided information on main factors towards the activity. Then, we carried out structural optimization and designed several new compounds to improve the predicted biological activity. To investigate the binding modes of the predicted compounds in the active site of PPARα/γ, a molecular docking simulation was carried out. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicated that the predicted ligands were stable in the active site of PPARα/γ. Therefore, combination of the CoMFA and structure-based drug design results could be used for further structural alteration and synthesis and development of novel and potent dual agonists.

The doxorubicin drug, DOX, in free form (DOXfree) and its complexes both inside (DOXin-SWCNT) and outside (DOXout-SWCNT) the pristine SWCNT were chosen to be the three modeled studied. It was found, as expected, due to the collaborative interaction with the surface of the tube that the DOX in the DOXin-SWCNT is much less flexible than that of the other two forms. The DOX in both complexes was also observed to form the aromatic stacking interaction with the SWCNT surface. Interestingly, the DOX in the DOXin-SWCNT and DOXout-SWCNT complexes were found to move from one end to the other of the SWCNT, parallel to the tube surface at the distance (from the center of mass of the drug to the tube surface) of 4.5 Å and 4.0 Å, respectively. In addition, simulations were also extended to the DOX, complexed inside the –OH and –COOH functionalized SWCNTs.

The NBEs of ligands’ substructures vis-à-vis active site indicated that pyridyl fragment (F2B4) in L7G and L8G, and amide fragment (F2B5) in LAR and L6G are in high energy states. Based on ligands’ substructures and active site residues properties new compounds were designed by introducing phenolic and amidine moieties, respectively, for F2B4 and F2B5. This improved NBEs of new compounds (NC2, –60.93 kcal/mol; NC3, -42.42 kcal/mol). Also, Zn2+ group (substructure F1) of largazoles was modified with that of SAHA and Trapoxin A. Here, the results indicated in favor of Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A. New compound NC6 incorporating aforesaid modifications i.e. phenolic moiety for F2B4, amidine moiety for F2B5 and Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A in F1, offered best interactions with HDAC8 (–89.75 kcal/mol).

In general, PCLs consist of a ligand of the target receptor covalently linked to an azobenzene, which can be reversibly switched between two configurations upon light illumination. Gluazo, as a PCL that targets excitatory amino acid receptors, in its dark-adapted trans iso-form was characterized to be a partial agonist of the kainate glutamate receptor GluK2. Application of UV light leads to the formation of the cis form, with remarkedly reduced affinity towards GluK2.

Apoptotic dysregulation can result in numerous pathological conditions, such as cancers, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegeneration. Members of the BCL-2 family of proteins regulate the process of apoptosis by its promotion or inhibition and overexpression of the pro-survival anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) has been associated with tumor maintenance, growth and progression Small molecules and peptides which bind the BH3 binding groove of these proteins have been explored in the recent times for their anticancer potential. The first anticancer agents targeting this family of proteins were aimed primarily toward inhibition of Bcl-2. An elevated level of Mcl-1, despite Bcl-2 inhibition, continues to be a cause for resistance in most cancers. However, in silico exploration of Mcl-1 specific drugs and their associated mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. In order to understand the same, we have carried out docking and molecular dynamic simulations on ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally active inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w proteins; Obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor as well as Maritoclax, an Mcl-1 specific inhibitor. Docking studies revealed that binding to the hydrophobic grooves is a prerequisite for action on the BCL protein and the binding mechanism and chemical space utilization dictates stability as well as specificity of the inhibitor molecular dynamic simulations showed that on binding, the α-helices of these proteins exhibited less fluctuations than loop regions, also hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding were observed to be the predominant interactions in the drug-receptor complexes.

Since the cases of delamination of the coating take place in dental practice, it is very important to estimate the adhesive strength of HAp with the implant. A measure of the coating-to-substrate bond strength is the energy of this bond. In this research, quantum chemistry is used to calculate the binding energy of functional groups (anions) of hydroxyapatite and titanium 2+, which is a standard implant material. First, using Density Functional Theory with Becke three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr hybrid exchange-correlation functional, the lowest potential energy surface is calculated. Then, by ab initio molecular dynamics, the reaction path, the reaction products, frequencies of oscillations, the activation energies and binding energies between various combinations of component anions of HAp and Ti(II) are calculated.",10.6084/m9.figshare.8227118.v1,90499 Chemical Engineering not elsewhere classified|91299 Materials Engineering not elsewhere classified|91207 Metals and Alloy Materials,,,,2019-01-01,figshare.ars,On Estimation of Adhesive Strength of Implants Bioactive Coating with Titanium by Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics Simulations,,

The code is built on top of the popular HOOMD-blue code, and as such harnesses the computational power of GPUs. The methodology makes use of the SAFT-γ Mie force field, so the resulting coarse grained pair potentials are both closely linked to and consistent with the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the simulated fluid. In raaSAFT both homonuclear and heteronuclear models are implemented for a wide range of compounds spanning from linear alkanes, to more complicated fluids such as water and alcohols, all the way up to nonionic surfactants and models of asphaltenes and resins. Adding new compounds as well as new features is made straightforward by the modularity of the code. To demonstrate the ease-of-use of raaSAFT, we give a detailed walkthrough of how to simulate liquid–liquid equilibrium of a hydrocarbon with water. We describe in detail how both homonuclear and heteronuclear compounds are implemented. To demonstrate the performance and versatility of raaSAFT, we simulate a large polymer-solvent mixture with 300 polystyrene molecules dissolved in 42 700 molecules of heptane, reproducing the experimentally observed temperature-dependent solubility of polystyrene. For this case we obtain a speedup of more than three orders of magnitude as compared to atomistically-detailed simulations.",10.17632/cfcwvnpbv3.1,Natural Sciences,,Natural Sciences,,2017-03-10,MENDELEY_DATA,raaSAFT: A framework enabling coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations based on the SAFT-γ Mie force field,article,1

The cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) with regulatory cyclin D (CDK6/v) drives cellular proliferation by phosphorylation reaction. To understand the CDK6 inhibitors i.e., flavonoids blocking the CDK6/Cyclin D at ATP binding pocket, MD simulations were performed on three flavonoid inhibitors complexed with CDK6/cyclin D in the four orientations, fisetin (FST-CDK6/v), apigenin (AGN-CDK6/v), chrysin (CHS_A-CDK6/v) and chrysin (CHS_B-CDK6/v). In all systems, the conserved strong H-bond at the 4-keto group of inhibitors via the backbone nitrogen of V101 was found. The 3'- and 4'-OH groups on the B ring were found to significantly increase in binding and inhibitory efficiency. The electrostatics interaction particularly the hydrogen bond formation, the vdW interactions with the I19, V27, F98, H100 and L152 were also found to increase in binding efficiency.

,"Mao, Dan",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1775,DATASET,,"Unrestricted The conditions in the solar interior are so extreme that it has so far been impossible to match them in a laboratory. However, for nearly 50 years solar oscillations have been precisely observed, and the wealth of their data has enabled us to study the interior of the Sun as if it were a laboratory. Helioseismology is the name of this branch of astrophysics. It allows a high-precision diagnostic of the thermodynamic quantities in the solar interior. High-quality thermodynamic quantities are crucial for successful solar modeling.; If good solar models are desired, considerable theoretical effort is required. Good solar models, in turn, are fundamental tools for solar physics. The most prominent example of this link between solar physics and basic physics was the resolution of the solar neutrino problem in 2002. The equation of state is a key material property that describes the relation between pressure, density and temperature. If the equation of state is derived from a thermodynamic potential it will also determine all associated thermodynamic quantities. A second key material property is the nuclear-energy production rate, which plays a crucial role in the solar core. Both are important physical properties describing the structure of the Sun. Both derive from microphysical models.; In the equation-of-state part, we have studied two models of the equation of state (EOS). One is the MHD EOS, which is widely used in solar models. In our research, we have incorporated new terms into the MHD EOS. These terms have been borrowed from the major competing formalism, the OPAL EOS. They were missing in the original MHD EOS. Not only do the upgrades bring MHD closer to the OPAL equation of state, which is well known for its better match with observations. Most importantly it will allow solar modelers to use the OPAL equation of state directly, without recourse to the OPAL tables distributed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Since the OPAL code is not publicly available, there is no alternative source. The official OPAL tables, however, have disadvantages. First, they are inflexible regarding the chemical mix, which is set once and for all by the producers of the tables. Our equation of state will allow the user to choose, in principle, an arbitrary mix. Second, the OPAL tables by their very nature are limited by the errors of interpolation within tables. The second equation of state model is a density expansion based on the Feynman-Kac path-integral formalism. By making use of the equivalence of quantum Hamiltonian matrix and the classical action of closed and open filaments (paths), an analytic formalism of equation of state. Although the character of density expansion limits its application, the formalism can still be valid in most region in the Sun. Our work provides the link between the abstract theoretical formalism that was developed in the 1990s and a numerically smooth realization that can be used in solar and stellar models. Since it is so far the most exact and systematic approach for an EOS, it provides another way to study the influence of different very fine physical effects, despite considerable limitations in its domain of applicability.; In the nuclear-reaction part of the thesis, we have used a molecular-dynamics method to simulate the motion of protons in a hydrogen plasma (which is a good approximation for this purpose). Quantum tunneling explains why nuclear fusion can occur in the first place, considering the ""low"" temperature in the solar core. It is well known that this tunneling is enhanced (which leads to higher nuclear reaction rates) in the presence of Coulomb screening. In the 1950, Salpeter formulated a theory based on the static-screened Coulomb potential, as derived by Debye and Huckel in the 1920s. As expected, Salpeter obtained enhanced reaction rates. But from our simulation, we confirmed the results of a recent controversy about the existence of a dynamic effect. Since the bulk of fusion reactions happens at the high end of the Maxwell distribution, this is an relevant issue. Our work is the first independent confirmation of such a dynamic effect.",10.25549/usctheses-m1775,equation of state|molecular-dynamics|nuclear-reaction rates|helioseismology|Physics|dense solar plasma,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Improved thermodynamics of the dense solar plasma and molecular-dynamics simulations of the nuclear-reaction rates,,

 Nature of problem 
 The set up and running of many simulations (all of the same type), from the command line, is a slow process. But most research quality codes, including the ab initio tight-binding code FIREBALL, are designed to run from the command line. The desire is to have a method for quickly and efficiently setting up and running a host of simulations.

By this parallel strategy, the size of simulation system will be never restricted to the throughput of a single CPU or GPU. The most critical technical problem is how to parallelize a CUNFFT in the parallel strategy, which is conquered effectively by deep-seated research of basic principles and some algorithm skills. Furthermore, the upgraded method is capable of computing electrostatic interactions for both the atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).

We examine this issue by way of the model protein Gloeobacter violaceous ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) using computational molecular dynamics, with a coarse-grained model to enhance sampling. We find that in flooding simulations, both propofol and a generic particle localize to the crystallographic transmembrane anesthetic binding region, and that propofol also localizes to an extracellular region shared with the crystallographic ketamine binding site. Subsequent simulations to probe these binding modes in greater detail demonstrate that ligand binding induces structural asymmetry in GLIC. Consequently, we employ residue interaction correlation analysis to describe the internal allosteric network underlying the coupling of ligand and distant effector sites necessary for conformational change. Overall, the results suggest that the same allosteric network may underlie the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site.",10.5061/dryad.sp025,ion channel|propofol|molecular dynamics|GLIC|allostery,Department of Anesthesiology|James J.

(ii) The use of coupled mocking to facilitate coverage of various parts of the code and allow rapid prototyping.

Experiments coupled with computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) have provided insight into the physics of membranes. We use long‐time and large‐scale MD simulations to study the structure, dynamics and mechanical behavior of membranes. ❧ We investigate shock‐induced collapse of nanobubbles in water using MD simulations based on a reactive force field. We observe a focused jet at the onset of bubble shrinkage and a secondary shock wave upon bubble collapse. The jet length scales linearly with the nanobubble radius, as observed in experiments on micron‐to‐millimeter size bubbles. Shock induces dramatic structural changes, including an ice‐VII‐like structural motif at a particle velocity of 1 km/s. The incipient ice VII formation and the calculated Hugoniot curve are in good agreement with experimental results. We also investigate molecular mechanisms of poration in lipid bilayers due to shock‐induced collapse of nanobubbles. Our multimillion‐atom MD simulations reveal that the jet impact generates shear flow of water on bilayer leaflets and pressure gradients across them. This transiently enhances the bilayer permeability by creating nanopores through which water molecules translocate rapidly across the bilayer. Effects of nanobubble size and temperature on the porosity of lipid bilayers are examined. ❧ The second research project focuses on cholesterol (CHOL) dynamics in phospholipid bilayers. Several experimental and computational studies have been performed on lipid bilayers consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and CHOL molecules. CHOL interleaflet transport (flip-flop) plays an important role in interleaflet coupling and determining CHOL flip‐flop rate has been elusive. Various studies report that the rate ranges between milliseconds to seconds. We calculate CHOL flip‐flop rates by performing a 15 μs all‐atom MD simulation of a DPPC–CHOL bilayer. We find that the CHOL flip‐flop rates are on the sub microsecond timescale. These results are verified by performing various independent parallel replica (PR) simulations. Our PR simulations provide significant boost in sampling of the flip‐flop events. We observe that the CHOL flip‐flop can induce membrane order, regulate membrane‐bending energy, and facilitate membrane relaxation. The rapid flip‐flop rates reported here have important implications for the role of CHOL in mechanical properties of cell membranes, formation of domains, and maintaining CHOL concentration asymmetry in plasma membrane. Our PR approach can reach submillisecond time scales and bridge the gap between MD simulations and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments on CHOL flip‐flop dynamics in membranes. ❧ The last project deals with transfection barriers encountered by a bare small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a phospholipid bilayer. SiRNA molecules play a pivotal role in therapeutic applications. A key limitation to the widespread implementation of siRNA‐based therapeutics is the difficulty of delivering siRNA‐based drugs to cells. We have examined structural and mechanical barriers to siRNA passage across a phospholipid bilayer using all‐atom MD simulations. We find that the electrostatic interaction between the anionic siRNA and head groups of phospholipid molecules induces a phase transformation from the liquid crystalline to ripple phase. Steered MD simulations reveal that the siRNA transfection through the ripple phase requires a force of ~ 1.5 nN.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-363504,DPPC bilayer|shock|cholesterol flip-flop|nanobubble collapse|siRNA|molecular dynamics|Physics|poration,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,"Shock-induced poration, cholesterol flip-flop and small interfering RNA transfection in a phospholipid membrane: multimillion atom, microsecond molecular dynamics simulations",,

The hits obtained have also been found to share structural features with some known antibiotics such as Amoxicillin.

Coarse grained models offer efficient ways to simulate systems whose properties lie at the mesoscale, which therefore cannot be represented by full atomistic models or continuum theory. The potential is applied to the molecular dynamics simulations of the coarse grained representation of molecules so as to see how successful the potential is in capturing the underlying physics.

These two quantities are related by the following simple expression:

A(r) = -kBT ln (g(r)) + C

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the system temperature, and C is a constant as a result of integration.

The potential derived in the first instance will not reproduce the physics of the reference system so there is an iterative process through which to improve the description of the reference system. This iterative Boltzmann inversion method is summarized by the following equation for a single state:

Vi+1(r) = Vi(r) – αkBT ln(gi(r)/gt(r))

where Vi(r) is the interaction potential after step i, α is a scaling factor to prevent large fluctuations in the updated potential, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, gi(r) the trial RDF, gt(r) the target RDF. This method will typically yield a potential that matches the target RDF well; however, the derived potentials tend to be state dependent and non-unique. The resulting potentials derived via this method may not capture the underlying potential, and therefore may lead to significant artifacts when considering other state points not included
in the original optimization.

Multi-state iterative Boltzmann inversion methods have been developed in order to overcome this limitation. In these methods, a single potential is updated to match structural data over N number of states by using the following:

Vi+1(r) = Vi(r) – (1/N) Σ {αs(r)kBTs ln(gsi(r)/gst(r))}

where the sum is taken over all states, and the “s” script denotes the property at state s. The scaling factor αs(r) is now a weighting factor for state s, allowing more or less emphasis to be put on this state in the potential update. The
parameter αs(r) is set to be a linear function of r such that the potential smoothly approaches zero at the cutoff.",2017-07-07,MENDELEY_DATA,Creating a Coarse-Grain Interaction Potential from All-Atom Simulation Data,article,2

 An analytical benchmark and a simple consistent Mathematica program are proposed for graphene and carbon nanotubes, that may serve to test any molecular dynamics code implemented with REBO potentials. By exploiting the benchmark, we checked results produced by LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) when adopting the second generation Brenner potential, we made evident that this code in its current implementation produces results which are offset from those of the b...

In the present study, we have analysed the RNA intervention mechanism exerted by flavoniod molecules against NS5 MTase RNA capping site by using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculations.

The results of MD simulation reveal that the RMSD and RMSF values of QGN-MTase complex have increased on comparing the apo protein due to the effect of ligand binding.

Transport of binary mixtures of n-alkane and CO2 in carbon nanopores and the effect of various parameters such as temperature, pressure, pore size and length of the system on the separation were investigated. For generating n-alkanes chains Configurational-bias Monte Carlo method was used and combined with the dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics simulation.; The next phase of this work is to study the transport of gas mixtures through nanoporous silicon carbide membranes using molecular dynamics simulation. We develop a new model for nanoporous materials and inorganic membranes, the pore space of which consists of interconnected pores of irregular shapes and sizes. The model is based on the Voronoi tessellation of the atomistic structure of the crystalline or amorphous materials, of which the membrane is made. It generates three-dimensional molecular pore networks with pore-size distributions (PSD) that resemble those of real inorganic nanoporous materials. In addition to being interconnected and having irregular shapes and distributed sizes, the pores also have rough internal surface, which is what one may expect to exist in most real nanoporous materials. To test the validity of the model, we utilize it to model adsorption in three distinct silicon-carbide (SiC) membranes. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are employed to compute adsorption isotherms of nitrogen in the nanoporous SiC membranes. Using at most one adjustable parameter, the simulated isotherms and the experimental data are in very goodagreement.; We also aim to simulate transport properties of our prepared SiC membranes using the feed back that we get from our adsorption simulation. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations used, in order to study transport and separation of two binary mixtures, namely, H2/CO2 and H2/CH4, and compare the results with the experimental data. The model is demonstrated to provide accurate predictions, in particular for the separation factors of the mixtures, without needing anyadjustable parameter.",10.25549/usctheses-m2620,adsorption|nanoscale|transport of gases|molecular dynamics simulation|Chemical Engineering|nanoporous|silicon carbide,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Molecular modeling of silicon carbide nanoporous membranes and transport and adsorption of gaseous mixtures therein,,

Penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenems along with the inhibitors such as tazobactam, sulbactam and clavulanic acid are prescribed for the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections. Prolonged exposure to β-lactam antibiotics leads to the development of resistance. The major reason for the β-lactam resistance in K. pneumoniae is the secretion of the enzyme K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Secretion of KPC-2 and its variant KPC-3 by the K. pneumoniae strains causes resistance to both the substrate imipenem and the β-lactamase inhibitors. Hence, molecular docking and dynamics studies were carried out to analyze the resistance mechanism of KPC-2–imipenem and KPC-3–imipenem at the structural level. It reveals that KPC-3-imipenem has the highest c-score value of 4.03 with greater stability than the KPC-2–imipenem c-score value of 2.36. Greater the interaction between the substrate and the β-lactamase enzyme, higher the chances of hydrolysis of the substrate. Presently available β-lactamase inhibitors are also ineffective against KPC-3-expressing strains. This situation necessitates the need for development of novel and effective inhibitors for KPC-3. We have carried out the virtual screening process to identify more effective inhibitors for KPC-3, and this has resulted in ZINC48682523, ZINC50209041 and ZINC50420049 as the best binding energy compounds, having greater binding affinity and stability than KPC-3–tazobactam interactions. Our study provides a clear understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance and provides valuable inputs for the development of inhibitors against KPC-3 expressing K. pneumoniae.

Penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenems along with the inhibitors such as tazobactam, sulbactam and clavulanic acid are prescribed for the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections. Prolonged exposure to β-lactam antibiotics leads to the development of resistance. The major reason for the β-lactam resistance in K. pneumoniae is the secretion of the enzyme K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Secretion of KPC-2 and its variant KPC-3 by the K. pneumoniae strains causes resistance to both the substrate imipenem and the β-lactamase inhibitors. Hence, molecular docking and dynamics studies were carried out to analyze the resistance mechanism of KPC-2–imipenem and KPC-3–imipenem at the structural level. It reveals that KPC-3-imipenem has the highest c-score value of 4.03 with greater stability than the KPC-2–imipenem c-score value of 2.36. Greater the interaction between the substrate and the β-lactamase enzyme, higher the chances of hydrolysis of the substrate. Presently available β-lactamase inhibitors are also ineffective against KPC-3-expressing strains. This situation necessitates the need for development of novel and effective inhibitors for KPC-3. We have carried out the virtual screening process to identify more effective inhibitors for KPC-3, and this has resulted in ZINC48682523, ZINC50209041 and ZINC50420049 as the best binding energy compounds, having greater binding affinity and stability than KPC-3–tazobactam interactions. Our study provides a clear understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance and provides valuable inputs for the development of inhibitors against KPC-3 expressing K. pneumoniae.

Abstract 
Biomolecular processes are governed by free energy changes and thus depend on a fine-tuned interplay between entropy and enthalpy. To calculate accurate values for entropies from simulations is particularly challenging for the solvation shell of proteins, which contributes crucially to the total entropy of solvated proteins, due to the diffusive motion of the solvent molecules. Accordingly, for each frame of a Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory, our software relabels the solvent molecules, su...

To establish the influence of different chemical functional groups on the aggregation pathway of natural asphaltenes, a series of model triphenylene-based compounds were investigated. Synthesized with alkoxy chains of varying length and amide appendages, both with and without an acid terminating moiety, their aggregation kinetics in toluene were studied over several length scales, using a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, complemented with GROMACS molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The chemical structures of the polyaromatic compounds play an important role in their aggregation behavior: non-centrosymmetric model compounds were more prone to aggregation and formed large clusters. Furthermore, polar components appear to have a more significant influence than π-stacking on the driving force of aggregation, as the large clusters formed were observed to possess multiple configurations. Both amide and acid groups could generate strong attractive forces between molecules, overcoming the energy barrier imposed by the aromatic solvent and molecular core. These conclusions underline a strong structure-function relationship, of a model system examined on multiple size-scales, in a single solvent.

However, biochemical analysis of some of these Hsp40 J-domain mutants has so far failed to provide major insight into the specific functional changes in Hsp40-Hsp70 interactions. To explore the detailed structural and dynamic properties of the Hsp40 J-domain, 20 ns molecular dynamic simulations of 4 mutants (D9A, D36A, A30T, and F45S) and wild-type J-domain were performed, followed by Hsp70 docking simulations. Results demonstrated that although the Hsp70 interaction mechanism of the mutants may vary, the major structural change was targeted to the critical HPD motif of the J-domain. Our computational analysis fits well with previous yeast genetics studies regarding highlighting the importance of J-domain function in prion propagation. During the molecular dynamics simulations several important residues were identified and predicted to play an essential role in J-domain structure.

 REACH (Realistic Extension Algorithm via Covariance Hessian) is a program package for residue-scale coarse-grained biomolecular simulation. The program calculates the force constants of a residue-scale elastic network model in single-domain proteins using the variance–covariance matrix obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Secondary-structure dependence of the force constants is integrated. The method involves self-consistent, direct mapping of atomistic simulation results o...

DFT-FE is based on a local real-space variational formulation of the Kohn–Sham DFT energy functional that is discretized using a higher-order adaptive spectral finite-element (FE) basis, and treats pseudopotential and all-electron calculations in the same framework, while accommodating non-periodic, semi-periodic and periodic boundary conditions. We discuss the main aspects of the code, which include, the various strategies of adaptive FE basis generation, and the different approaches employed in the numerical implementation of the solution of the discrete Kohn–Sham problem that are focused on significantly reducing the floating point operations, communication costs and latency. We demonstrate the accuracy of DFT-FE by comparing the energies, ionic forces and periodic cell stresses on a wide range of problems with popularly used DFT codes. Further, we demonstrate that DFT-FE significantly outperforms widely used plane-wave codes—both in CPU-times and wall-times, and on both non-periodic and periodic systems—at systems sizes beyond a few thousand electrons, with over 5-10 fold speedups in systems with more than 10,000 electrons. The benchmark studies also highlight the excellent parallel scalability of DFT-FE, with strong scaling demonstrated on up to 192,000 MPI tasks.",10.17632/tgdmgvmfft.1,Electronic Structure|Computational Physics|Molecular Dynamics|Electronic Band Structure,,Electronic Structure|Computational Physics|Molecular Dynamics|Electronic Band Structure,,2019-10-30,MENDELEY_DATA,DFT-FE – A massively parallel adaptive finite-element code for large-scale density functional theory calculations,article,1

It is widely used by researchers in cell biology and the medical field to manipulate biological systems at the cellular level. For decades, electroporation has been studied extensively through experiments and theoretical models, and electroporation‐based technologies have been improved substantially with these efforts. One of the issues in utilizing electroporation is the lack of understanding in the phenomenon’s molecular mechanism and the microscopic details, mainly due to the difficulty in the direct experimental observation of the nanosecond‐scale electropore formation process and the nanometer‐sized electropore structure. To overcome this issue, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation has become one of the major tools to study electroporation at the microscopic level. ❧ Recent advancements of high performance computing, such as the increase in processing power, developments in algorithms and parallelization, have improved the efficiency of MD simulation substantially. Due to these advancements, MD simulation has become a popular tool for studying systems that are composed of biomolecules. For nearly a decade of effort, MD simulation revealed many different aspects of electroporation and it provided a molecular description of the process. Using MD simulation, we are able to observe the events during the electropore formation and annihilation, as well as the transport processes of molecules through the electropore. In addition, MD simulation provides a platform to study the molecular structure of electropore, and the associated energetic. ❧ My dissertation is organized as the follows: Chapter 1 provides the motivation of this research by discussing the applications of electroporation‐based technology, electroporation experiments, and the existing continuum model that describes electroporation. Chapter 2 introduces the MD formalism, models, and various algorithms used in our MD simulation. I will also discuss some of the previous MD studies of electroporation and their significances at the end of Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, we will examine the dynamics of water bridge during different stages of electroporation, and delineate the role of water molecules in electroporation by comparing the lipid bilayer system with an artificial water‐vacuum‐water system. In Chapter 4, we will examine the steady state of an electropore in lipid bilayer and evaluate the pore conductance of ions. The pore conductance values obtained from the simulations can be compared with those obtained by experiments. In Chapter 5, we will examine the effects that monovalent ions impose on lipid bilayer and electropore formation. We will also examine the pore conductance of ions under various ion concentrations, and the PS translocation process. At the end, I will summarize the findings in our research and provide a short outlook on MD simulation in the study of electroporation.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-376394,electropermeabilization|cell membrane|electropore|molecular dynamics|Physics|monovalent salt,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Molecular simulations of water and monovalent ion dynamics in the electroporation of phospholipid bilayers,,

This class of compounds is attributed with very rich nutritional as well as therapeutic values. The present study focuses on a panel of 16 flavonoid molecules that are demonstrated to exhibit various bioactivities like anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory as well as possess antioxidant potential. The electronic basis of these bioactivities is rarely explored, and structural basis of flavonoid-induced cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition has still remained an uncharted area. The current report thus focuses on providing an electronic explanation of these bioactivities using density functional theory-based quantum chemical descriptors.

To explore the detailed structural and dynamic properties of the Hsp40 J-domain, 20 ns molecular dynamic simulations of 4 mutants (D9A, D36A, A30T, and F45S) and wild-type J-domain were performed, followed by Hsp70 docking simulations.

Their CDI performance is tested in terms of water flux and ion rejection, and the effect of ZIF types is investigated and explained by radial distribution function (RDF) and ion distribution. The results show that ion adsorption in the ZIF electrode takes place at its metal and nitrogen atoms, and ion rejection can be as high as 100% for salty ions in the starting period. However, the heavy metal ions Cr6+ and Cl- ions agglomerate constantly and the ion adsorption by the ZIFs deteriorates with time. It is also found that the water flux is affected by the number of ions inside both the nanochannel and the ZIF electrodes as well as the ZIF hydrophilicity which is influenced by the type of metal atoms used.

Medicinal plants can also have non-traditional use in phytoremediation technologies. Among the heavy metals, Cadmium (Cd) is the most abundant and readily taken up by the crop plants. Plant metallothioneins (MTs) are small proteins having cysteine-rich residues and appear to play key roles in metal homoeostasis. Plant metallothionein 2 (MT 2) from Coptis japonica (Gold-thread; CjMT 2) is a typical member of this subfamily and features two cysteine-rich regions containing eight and six cysteine residues, respectively, separated by 42 amino acids long linker region. In-silico analysis of MT 2 protein sequences of C. japonica was performed. In this study, ab initio methods were utilised for the prediction of three-dimensional structure of CjMT 2. After structure validation, heavy metal-binding sites were predicted for the selected modelled structures of CjMT 2. To obtain Cdi-CjMT 2 (i = 1–7), metalated complex individual docking experiments were performed. The stability of the metalated docked structures was assessed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Our study showed that CjMT 2 binds up to 4 Cd2+ ions in two distinct domains: a N-terminal β-domain that binds to 2 Cd2+ ions and a C-terminal α-domain that binds with 2 Cd2+ ions. Our analysis revealed that Cys residues of alpha and beta domain and some residues of spacer region of CjMT 2 protein might be important for the cadmium interaction. MD simulation studies provided insight into metal-induced conformational changes and mechanism of metalation of CjMT 2, an intrinsically disordered protein. This study provides useful insights into mechanism of cadmium-type 2 metallothionein interaction.",10.6084/m9.figshare.7938605.v1,Plant Biology|110309 Infectious Diseases|Molecular Biology|39999 Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified|69999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified|Biochemistry|Biophysics|Cell Biology,,,,2019-01-01,figshare.ars,"Cadmium-induced conformational changes in type 2 metallothionein of medicinal plant Coptis japonica: insights from molecular dynamics studies of apo, partially and fully metalated forms",,

In 2009, we studied the conformational transition between open and closed E. coli AdK without substrate, i.e. &ldquo;apo AdK&rdquo;, with a variety of computational methods.2 As part of the study we also produced a free energy landscape (a potential of mean force or PMF) as a function of two collective variables, the angles formed by the LID and NMP domains with the CORE domain.3 We 2 and others4,5 have used this PMF to compare methods that sample transition paths to the underlying free energy landscape.

 Nature of problem 
 Given a set of ab initio points of a molecular system with N atoms, the problem is to obtain a global analytic (3N - 6)-dimensional representation of the corresponding adiabatic potential having all the symmetry properties of the system and satisfying the stringent criteria [1] needed in molecular dynamical calculations. In the part I of this series we have dealt with triatomic systems and three-dimensional (3D) representations. In the present part II.1 of this series we treat the ABCD class of ...

This class of compounds is attributed with very rich nutritional as well as therapeutic values. The present study focuses on a panel of 16 flavonoid molecules that are demonstrated to exhibit various bioactivities like anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory as well as possess antioxidant potential. The electronic basis of these bioactivities is rarely explored, and structural basis of flavonoid-induced cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition has still remained an uncharted area. The current report thus focuses on providing an electronic explanation of these bioactivities using density functional theory-based quantum chemical descriptors. We also attempt to provide a structure–activity relation model for COX by inhibition of these 16 flavonoids using molecular docking. Here, we report molecular dynamics data from 16 flavonoid–COX-2 complexes performed for 50 nanoseconds each that demonstrates key structural and dynamic aspects of flavonoid-based COX inhibition in light of observed experimental facts. Interaction analysis and evaluation of side-chain dynamics presented in current study are well in agreement with the empirical study and is hoped to pave new avenues towards design and development of COX-2 selective chemical agents.

The intervals of temperature and pressure are taken as inputs and the relevant energy and volume regions are determined on the fly. In this way the method guarantees adequate statistics for the chosen TP region. We show that our multithermal-multibaric simulations can be used to calculate all static physical quantities for all temperatures and pressures in the targeted region of the TP plane. We illustrate our approach by studying the density anomaly of TIP4P/Ice water.

The first set pertains to DFT simulations using the ABINIT software, while the second is for MD simulations using LAMMPS. According to the new theory presented in this paper, pressure-induced amorphization is concomitant with high temperatures and results in local melting of the material. Such molten regions lose their original crystalline structure, and that loss in structural integrity sustains even on cooling. MD studies were utilized to present this phenomenon and the relevant data is included. The theory also provides a new rationale for Raman spectra of amorphized boron carbide, wherein, amorphization causes local volume increase and causes compression in the surrounding crystalline matrix. The new amorphization peaks arise from compressed crystalline material; crystalline peaks migrate (shift) and give rise to the new spectrum. DFT simulations were conducted to estimate such migrations on application of different levels of pressure.

The virtual interaction sites (VIS) method replaces hydrogen atoms by massless virtual interaction sites to eliminate these degrees of freedom while keeping intact nonbonded interactions and the explicit treatment of hydrogen atoms. We have modified the existing VIS algorithm for most lipids in the popular CHARMM36 force field by increasing the hydrogen atom masses at regular intervals in the lipid acyl chains and obtained lipid properties and pore formation free energies in very good agreement with those calculated in simulations without VIS. Our modified VIS scheme enables a 5 fs time step resulting in a significant performance gain for all-atom simulations of membranes. The method has the potential to make longer time and length scales accessible in all-atom simulations of membrane–protein complexes.

Abstract 
Long-range hydrodynamic interactions have been implemented into the open-source molecular dynamics package, LAMMPS, though the creation of a fix, lb_fluid. These interactions are treated by interpolating the MD particle density onto a discrete lattice, which is then coupled to the fluid. A thermal lattice-Boltzmann algorithm is used to model the fluid, which includes mass and momentum conserving noise, providing a thermostat for both the particles and the fluid.
 
 
 
 

Title of program: fix_lb_fluid
Catalogue Id: AEPH_v1_0

Nature of problem 
The inclusion of long-range hydrodynamic effects into molecular dynamics simulations requires the presence of an explicit solvent. Currently, the only option for incorporating such a solvent into a LAMMPS [1] simulation is the explicit inclusion of each of the individual solvent molecules. This is obviously quite computationally intensive, and for large system sizes can quickly become impractical.

We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged refinement, where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation–libration–screw (TLS) model. Modeling of 20 protein datasets at 1.1–3.1 Å resolution reduced cross-validated R_free values by 0.3–4.9%, indicating that ensemble models fit the X-ray data better than single structures. The ensembles revealed that, while most proteins display a well-ordered core, some proteins exhibit a ‘molten core’ likely supporting functionally important dynamics in ligand binding, enzyme activity and protomer assembly. Order–disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues.

This forms a primary strategy to block the association of transcription factors to promoters and subsequently, reduce the expression of genes. We present here an integrated approach combining various docking scoring functions, selective ligand-based pharmacophore models, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations to prioritize natural compounds specific to GC minor groove binding. The approach initially applies a selective ligand-based pharmacophore model built upon known GC minor groove binders to identify potential GC minor groove binders from natural compound repositories. These GC minor groove binders were then cross-examined with selective pharmacophore models (controls) based on AT-rich binders and GC intercalators to assess its unfitness. This approach involves the calculation of binding energies of known GC- and AT minor groove binders using three scoring functions without any constraint on groove specificity of GC- and AT-rich DNA. The evaluation of empirical scoring functions led to enumeration of a new parameter, the energy difference computed using Glide (sensitivity = 80%) to recognize GC-rich binders effectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations (MM/GBSA) constituted the final phase of this approach to analyze the interactions of natural molecules (hits) with GC-rich DNA comprehensively. Seven natural molecules were selected which exhibited fewer fluctuations in RMSD and RMSF profiles and better GC-rich DNA binding with low free energies of binding. These natural hits prioritized by this integrated approach can be tested in DNA binding assay. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We present here an integrated approach combining various docking scoring functions, selective ligand-based pharmacophore models, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations to prioritize natural compounds specific to GC minor groove binding. The approach initially applies a selective ligand-based pharmacophore model built upon known GC minor groove binders to identify potential GC minor groove binders from natural compound repositories. These GC minor groove binders were then cross-examined with selective pharmacophore models (controls) based on AT-rich binders and GC intercalators to assess its unfitness. This approach involves the calculation of binding energies of known GC- and AT minor groove binders using three scoring functions without any constraint on groove specificity of GC- and AT-rich DNA. The evaluation of empirical scoring functions led to enumeration of a new parameter, the energy difference computed using Glide (sensitivity = 80%) to recognize GC-rich binders effectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations (MM/GBSA) constituted the final phase of this approach to analyze the interactions of natural molecules (hits) with GC-rich DNA comprehensively. Seven natural molecules were selected which exhibited fewer fluctuations in RMSD and RMSF profiles and better GC-rich DNA binding with low free energies of binding. These natural hits prioritized by this integrated approach can be tested in DNA binding assay. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, the role played by solvents in affecting crystal morphology remains elusive. Here, we accompany experiments with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate crystallization of an anti-tuberculosis drug, isoniazid, in different solvents. Experiments show that isoniazid grows as needle-like crystals in water, while in alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, it exhibits a rod-like crystal habit. The aspect ratio of isoniazid crystals decreases with the decrease in the relative solvent polarity. We modeled these experiments by performing molecular dynamics simulations of isoniazid crystallization in different solvents at constant chemical potential thus keeping the solution concentration constant.

On the other hand, the slow growing (0 0 2) surface appears to follow a stepwise growth mechanism, with a surface integration step chiefly controlling the growth.

To model these processes requires the development and utilization of theories in electronic structure and quantum dynamics. One of the most popular methods for modeling nuclear-electronic dynamics is surface hopping. In this dissertation, surface hopping will be presented in different spotlights. We describe the method along with its advantages, disadvantages, and the contributions we make to improve its reliability and applicability. These efforts are carried out with simple Hamiltonians that can be solved exactly, thus allowing for an assessment of this approximate method. While this is an important step in methods development, modeling the large number of degrees of freedom in realistic systems requires efficient software. We present a software that combines surface hopping with numerically efficient methods for calculating ground and excited state potential energy surfaces—a necessary feature for modeling systems made up of hundreds of atoms and processes lasting up to tens of picoseconds. As part of our contribution to this software, we implement and benchmark an implicit solvent model, including investigating its effects during the nonradiative relaxation in organic conjugated molecules. The ultimate goal is to improve and assess the accuracy of these theoretical tools with the intention of progressing real-life applications. Having said that, a portion of this dissertation explores the early stages of an application called photoactive energetic materials—a field seeking to discover mechanically and electrically insensitive materials that undergo detonation through optical initiation. Our work investigates the optical properties in energetic materials, identified through an experimental collaboration, and is aimed at unveiling design principles to enhance control over the initiation threshold. In summary, we provide a comprehensive view of atomistic simulations of photoexcited molecules, starting from the methods used to describe electronic transitions through a manifold of excited states as a result of photoexcitation, followed by the development of software used to model realistic systems, and finally the use of such tools to discover how desired photophysical properties can be attained for practical use. The final part of this dissertation explores a new and booming field of research in the computational sciences called machine learning. Machine learning is a clever way of attaining calculations of ab initio accuracy at a tiny fraction of the computational cost through the use of statistically trained models.

In particular, fabrication of SiC membranes by pyrolysis of a polymer precursor that contains Si is quite attractive for separation of hydrogen from other gases. It has been quite difficult to extract atomistic-scale information about such SiC membranes, since they are amorphous. The research presented in this dissertation extends the ReaxFF reactive force field to describe the processes involved in the thermal decomposition of hydridopolycarbosilane (HPCS) to form SiC nanoporous membranes. ❧ First, we carry out quantum mechanical calculations on models meant to capture the important reaction steps and structures. Then, we develop a model of the HPCS polymer and utilize ReaxFF to describe the thermal degradation and decomposition of the polymer as the system is heated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the next step, we use ReaxFF for reactive dynamics of HPCS over a wide range of temperature. We then simulate pyrolysis of the HPCS under conditions that closely mimic the conditions of the fabrication of nanoporous SiC membranes to produce amorphous SiC material. The pyrolysis results and the computed properties of the SiC ceramic are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data. ❧ To further test the validity of the model and to provide insight into improving the performance of the membrane, extensive MD simulations were carried out to compute the self-diffusivities of H₂, CO₂ and CH₄ in the molecular model of SiC. The results indicate higher values of the diffusivity for H₂. The morphology of the amorphous SiC layer is characterized by computing its accessible free volumes and the cavity distributions. ❧ Finally, we use the molecular model of SiC and non-equilibrium MD simulations in order to study transport and separation in the membrane of two binary gaseous mixtures, namely, H₂/CO₂ and H₂/CH₄ at various temperatures and pressure drops, applied externally to the membrane. When compared with our own experimental data, the model is demonstrated to provide accurate predictions for various properties of interest and, in particular, for the separation factors of the mixtures. The model can be used to determine the optimal membrane's thickness.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-283510,pyrolysis simulation of HPCS|diffusion of gases|silicon-carbide membranes|ReaxFF force filed development|amorphous SiC model|separation of gaseous mixtures|Chemical Engineering,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,A process-based molecular model of nano-porous silicon carbide membranes,,

Abstract 
ASEP/MD is a computer program designed to implement the Averaged Solvent Electrostatic Potential/Molecular Dynamics (ASEP/MD) method developed by our group. It can be used for the study of solvent effects and properties of molecules in their liquid state or in solution. It is written in the FORTRAN90 programming language, and should be easy to follow, understand, maintain and modify. Given the nature of the ASEP/MD method, external programs are needed for the quantum calculations and molecula...

Title of program: ASEP/MD
Catalogue Id: ADSF_v1_0

Nature of problem 
The study of molecules in solution with quantum methods is a difficult task because of the large number of molecules and configurations that must be taken into account. The quantum mechanies/molecular mechanics methods proposed to date either require massive computational power or oversimplify the solute quantum description.

For example, simulations of conformational changes during the voltage-induced transition and ion current represent a major challenge that cannot be overcome at present by brute-force molecular dynamics approaches. To progress on this front, we developed and validated a renormalization approach and extended our previously developed coarse grained (CG) model so that it can describe the effect of the membrane potential and electrolyte solutions. Here we apply our model in realistic simulations of the energetics of the Kv1.2 channel. The simulations reproduce the observed experimental trend for both the gating charge and the effect of the membrane potential on the stability of the closed and open conformations. This indicates that our CG modeling offers a powerful tool for simulating voltage-activated channels.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-37354,Chemistry|renormalization|Langevin dynamics|coarse-grain|molecular dynamics|Kv1.2,,,,2012-01-01,usc.dl,"Capturing the complexity of ion channels: simulations of long-time dynamics, conformational changes and the effect of the membrane potential",,

Mutagenic studies suggest that MscL gating strongly depends on both intra-protein and interfacial lipid-protein interactions. However, there is a gap between this detailed chemical information and current mechanical models of MscL gating. Here, we investigate the MscL bilayer-protein interface through molecular dynamics simulations, and take a combined continuum-molecular approach to connect chemistry and mechanics. We quantify the effect of membrane tension on the forces acting on the surface of the channel, and identify interactions that may be critical in the force transduction between the membrane and MscL. We find that the local stress distribution on the protein surface is largely asymmetric, particularly under tension, with the cytoplasmic side showing significantly larger and more localized forces, which pull the protein radially outward. The molecular interactions that mediate this behavior arise from hydrogen bonds between the electronegative oxygens in the lipid headgroup and a cluster of positively charged lysine residues on the amphipathic S1 domain and the C-terminal end of the second trans-membrane helix. We take advantage of this strong interaction (estimated to be 10–13 kT per lipid) to actuate the channel (by applying forces on protein-bound lipids) and explore its sensitivity to the pulling magnitude and direction. We conclude by highlighting the simple motif that confers MscL with strong anchoring to the bilayer, and its presence in various integral membrane proteins including the human mechanosensitive channel K2P1 and bovine rhodopsin.",10.5061/dryad.ph510,force transduction|mechanosensitive channel of large conductance|stress tensor|central force decomposition|traction|MscL|lateral pressure profiles|mechanosensation|lipid binding,LaCàN|Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTech|Sandia National Laboratories|Center for Biological and Material Sciences,,,2014-12-03,DRYAD,Data from: Force transduction and lipid binding in MscL: a continuum-molecular approach,,

Understanding the molecular mechanism of viscoelastic polymer enhanced-oil-recovery in nanopores is of great significance for the advancement of oil exploitation. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the detailed process of the viscoelastic polymer displacing oil at the atomic scale. We found that the interactions between polymer chains and oil provide an additional pulling effect on extracting the residual oil trapped in dead-end nanopores, which plays a key role in increasing the oil displacement efficiency. Our results also demonstrate that the oil displacement ability of polymer can be reinforced with the increasing chain length and viscoelasticity. In particular, polymer with longer chain length exhibits stronger elastic property, which enhances the foregoing pulling effect.

It reveals that the dual phosphorylation does not change overall size and secondary structure element fraction, while a change in the distribution of hydrogen bonds induces slightly more pre-existing bound helical conformations. MSM analysis indicates that the dual phosphorylation accelerates conformation exchange between disordered and order-like states in target-binding region. It suggests that p53 TAD2 after phosphorylation would be more apt to bind to both the human p62 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the yeast tfb1 PH domain through different binding mechanism, where experimentally it exhibits an extended and α-helix conformation, respectively, with increased binding strength in both complexes.

How phosphorylation modulates structural ensemble of disordered peptide remains largely unexplored. Here, using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and Markov state model (MSM), the conformational distribution and kinetics of p53 N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) 2 as well as its dual-site phosphorylated form (pSer46, pThr55) were simulated. It reveals that the dual phosphorylation does not change overall size and secondary structure element fraction, while a change in the distribution of hydrogen bonds induces slightly more pre-existing bound helical conformations. MSM analysis indicates that the dual phosphorylation accelerates conformation exchange between disordered and order-like states in target-binding region. It suggests that p53 TAD2 after phosphorylation would be more apt to bind to both the human p62 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the yeast tfb1 PH domain through different binding mechanism, where experimentally it exhibits an extended and α-helix conformation, respectively, with increased binding strength in both complexes. Our study implies except binding interface, both conformation ensemble and kinetics should be considered for the effects of phosphorylation on IDPs.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of viscoelastic polymer enhanced-oil-recovery in nanopores is of great significance for the advancement of oil exploitation. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the detailed process of the viscoelastic polymer displacing oil at the atomic scale. We found that the interactions between polymer chains and oil provide an additional pulling effect on extracting the residual oil trapped in dead-end nanopores, which plays a key role in increasing the oil displacement efficiency. Our results also demonstrate that the oil displacement ability of polymer can be reinforced with the increasing chain length and viscoelasticity. In particular, polymer with longer chain length exhibits stronger elastic property, which enhances the foregoing pulling effect.

,"Van, Ngo Anh",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-361458,DATASET,,"The fundamental laws of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and the deeper understandings of quantum mechanics have been rebuilt in recent years. It is partly because of the increasing power of computing resources nowadays, that allow shedding direct insights into the connections among the thermodynamics laws, statistical nature of our world, and the concepts of quantum mechanics, which have not yet been understood. But mostly, the most important reason, also the ultimate goal, is to understand the mechanisms, statistics and dynamics of biological systems, whose prevailing non-equilibrium processes violate the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, deviate from statistical mechanics, and finally complicate quantum effects. ❧ I believe that investigations of the fundamental laws of non-equilibrium dynamics will be a frontier research for at least several more decades. One of the fundamental laws was first discovered in 1997 by Jarzynski, so-called Jarzynski’s Equality. Since then, different proofs, alternative descriptions of Jarzynski’s Equality, and its further developments and applications have been quickly accumulated. My understandings, developments and applications of an alternative theory on Jarzynski’s Equality form the bulk of this dissertation. The core of my theory is based on stepwise pulling protocols, which provide deeper insight into how fluctuations of reaction coordinates contribute to free‐energy changes along a reaction pathway. We find that the most optimal pathways, having the largest contribution to free‐energy changes, follow the principle of detailed balance. This is a glimpse of why the principle of detailed balance appears so powerful for sampling the most probable statistics of events. In a further development on Jarzynski’s Equality, I have been trying to use it in the formalism of diagonal entropy to propose a way to extract useful thermodynamic quantities such temperature, work and free-energy profiles from far‐from‐equilibrium ensembles, which can be used to characterize non-equilibrium dynamics. ❧ Furthermore, we have been applied the stepwise pulling protocols and Jarzynski’s Equality to investigate the ion selectivity of potassium channels via molecular dynamics simulations. The mechanism of the potassium ion selectivity has remained poorly understood for over fifty years, although a Nobel Prize was awarded to the discovery of the molecular structure of a potassium‐selective channel in 2003. In one year of performing simulations, we were able to reproduce the major results of ion selectivity accumulated in fifty years. We have been even boldly going further to propose a new model for ion selectivity based on the structural rearrangement of the selectivity filter of potassium-selective KcsA channels. This structural rearrangement has never been shown to play such a pivotal role in selecting and conducting potassium ions, but effectively rejecting sodium ions. Using the stepwise pulling protocols, we are also able to estimate conductance for ion channels, which remains elusive by using other methods. In the light of ion channels, we have also investigated how a synthetic channel of telemeric G‐quadruplex conducts different types of ions. These two studies on ion selectivity not only constitute an interesting part of this dissertation, but also will enable us to further explore a new set of ion‐selectivity principles. ❧ Beside the focus of my dissertation, I used million-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical properties of body-centered-cubic (BCCS) and face‐centered‐cubic (FCCS) supercrystals of DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles. These properties are valuable for examining whether these supercrystals can be used in gene delivery and gene therapy. The formation of such ordered supercrystals is useful to protect DNAs or RNAs from being attacked and destroyed by enzymes in cells. I also performed all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations to study a pure oleic acid (OA) membrane in water that results into a triple‐layer structure. The simulations show that the trans‐membrane movement of water and OAs is cooperative and correlated, and agrees with experimentally measured absorption rates. The simulation results support the idea that OA flip‐flop is more favorable than transport by means of functional proteins. This study might provide further insight into how primitive cell membranes work, and how the interplay and correlation between water and fatty acids may occur.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-361458,free‐energy|work|G-quadruplex|thermodynamics|fatty acid|lipid|Physics|ion channels|supercrystals|DNA|protein|temperature|ions|non-equilibrium,,,,2014-01-01,usc.dl,Step‐wise pulling protocols for non-equilibrium dynamics,,

Abstract 
Aside from numerical algorithms and problem setup, large-scale physics simulations on distributed-memory supercomputers require more basic utilitarian functionality, such as physical units and constants; display to the screen or standard output device; message passing; I/O to disk; and runtime parameter management and usage statistics.

The zero-field hole mobility is shown to increase as the annealing temperature or average molecular weights of samples are increased, in accordance with experimental results. Crystal structure analysis shows that the annealing temperature dependence of the mobility can be attributed to the size and structural order of the crystallites in both the chain-backbone and π-stacking directions. However, the molecular weight dependence of the mobility cannot be rationalized in the same way. Longer chains are shown to belong to more crystallites in the morphology, suggesting that the crystals become better connected as the molecular weight of the sample increases. We show that engineering samples to have an increased fraction of these long “tie chains” within the morphology improves mobility. As such, we propose that crystal connectivity in the noncrystalline portions of the morphology is similarly important in determining carrier mobility as crystallite size and order for semicrystalline conjugated polymers.,",10.15128/8k71nh08w,Charge Transport|Charge Transport simulations in P3HT|P3HT|Course grained molecular morphologies,,,,2016-01-01,bl.durham,Relating Molecular Morphology to Charge Mobility in Semi-Crystalline Conjugated Polymers: Underpinning data,,

In the study, we applied the computational pipeline of molecular docking followed by the molecular dynamics simulations to shortlist potential βdGT protein targets. The analysis of protein dynamics and the binding free energy (ΔG) led us to the identification of HK4 as a key βdGT target, whereby the binding mode and domain dynamics suggested the activator function of βdGT. βdGT bound to the allosteric site of the isozyme ∼13 Å away from the substrate (glucose)-binding site. The binding free energy of the ligand-protein complex was energetically feasible (ΔG, –41.61 kcal/mol) and the cleft angle deviation between the two (small and large) domains of HK4 revealed differential HK4 dynamics in response to βdGT binding. 3D structure analysis of the isozyme-ligand complex highlighted the role of Arg63, Glu67 and Lys458 in ligand stabilization and hydrophobic interactions mediated by Tyr214 and Met235. Experimental validation of the results of computational analysis confirmed the activator function of βdGT on HK4. The study has implication in diabetes as βdGT may be used to lower the blood glucose level by activating hepatic and pancreatic hexokinase without the risk of hypoglycemia.

Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for nanoindentation on the crystalline cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) and sulfur-induced embrittlement at nickel grain boundaries.; Multimillion-atom molecular dynamics simulations of nanoindentation on 3C-SiC surfaces corresponding to three different crystallographic directions, (110), (001), and (111), have been performed using pyramidal-shaped Vickers indenter with 90˚ edge angle. Load-displacement (P-h) curves show major and minor pop-in events during loading. Our analysis shows that the first minor discontinuity in the P-h curve of (110) indentation is related to nucleation of dislocations, whereas the subsequent major load-drops are related to the dissipation of accumulated energy by expansion of dislocation loops and changes of slip planes. Detailed quantitative analysis on the stress distribution on slip planes and stress concentration at kinks and dislocation cores has estimated the Peierls stress to be 7.5GPa~0.039G , where G is the shear modulus. We have observed anisotropic pileup patterns which all reside on (111) and (-1-11)  slip planes after the indenter is unloaded. These patterns are closely related to dislocation activities on the two slip planes. The anisotropy is a consequence of the asymmetry of the 3C-SiC crystal in which only (111) and (-1-11)  slip planes are active out of {111} family.; Alteration of fracture behaviors of a material by minute segregated impurities at grain boundaries is a fundamental question encompassing chemistry, mechanics and material science. One of the well-known examples is sulfur segregation-induced embrittlement of nickel grain boundaries, where coincidence between the critical sulfur concentration for embrittlement and that for amorphization remains unexplained. We have performed 48 million-atom reactive molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations to investigate the role of sulfur. A direct link between sulfur-induced intergranular amorphization and embrittlement is thus established. Analysis shows that an order-of-magnitude reduction of grain-boundary shear strength due to amorphization, combined with tensile-strength reduction, allows the crack tip to always find an easy propagation path. This mechanism explains an experimentally observed crossover from transgranular to intergranular fracture and suppressed plastic activities due to sulfur segregation.",10.25549/usctheses-m2685,grain boundary embrittlement|nanocrystalline|nickel|Materials Science|nanoindentation|molecular dynamics|silicon carbide,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Nanoindentation of silicon carbide and sulfur-induced embrittlement of nickel,,

PFCs were reported to bind to many proteins causing a series of biological effects. It was quite possible that the in vivo action of PFCs was not a single target or a single pathway, suggesting the toxic effect was due to the disturbance of protein or gene network, not limited to the modification of a single target protein or gene. Thus, a PFCs-targets interaction network was constructed and the significant differences in the characteristics of complex networks between the branched PFCs and linear PFCs were observed. A molecular dynamics simulation proved that binding ability of the branched PFCs to the target protein was much weaker than that of the linear PFCs, explaining why the branched PFCs presented significantly difference from the linear PFCs in terms of complex network characteristics. In addition, four target genes were identified as the central node genes of the network. The four target genes were proved to present certain influences on some diseases, which suggested a high correlation between PFCs to these diseases, including obesity, hepatocellular carcinoma and diabetes. The present work was helpful to develop new approaches to identify the key toxic targets of compounds and to explore the toxicity effects on pathways.

Thus, a PFCs-targets interaction network was constructed and the significant differences in the characteristics of complex networks between the branched PFCs and linear PFCs were observed. A molecular dynamics simulation proved that binding ability of the branched PFCs to the target protein was much weaker than that of the linear PFCs, explaining why the branched PFCs presented significantly difference from the linear PFCs in terms of complex network characteristics. In addition, four target genes were identified as the central node genes of the network. The four target genes were proved to present certain influences on some diseases, which suggested a high correlation between PFCs to these diseases, including obesity, hepatocellular carcinoma and diabetes. The present work was helpful to develop new approaches to identify the key toxic targets of compounds and to explore the toxicity effects on pathways.

,Thananchai Piroonpan,https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2008.1583,DATASET,,"A three-dimensional particle simulation model of plasma motion under the influence of the highly negative periodic electrical pulse was proposed. The pulses with the time period of 0-30 sec was applied under the periodic boundary condition. The ion density distribution was determined by the Maxwell’s and Lorentz force equations. The electrical pulse did not affect the ion density distribution when the frequency of the pulses was higher than the plasma frequency. The study simulated and analyzed the penetration of the ions in the crystalline medium by employing the molecular dynamic model. The universal ZBL long range potential and the Lennard Jones short range potential were considered in order to determine the interatomic force in the crystalline material, which impeded the motion of an ion in the medium. For this study, the molecular dynamic model was numerically implemented to determine the ion range and to describe the effect on the motion of an ion in the medium. Since the ion range in the lattice medium evaluated by this model was found to be comparable to the result obtained from the standard TRIM/SRIM code, it was concluded that the molecular model was adequate for the calculation of the ion range with the advantage that the motion of an ion in the crystalline medium could also be analyzed. The developed model was then used to describe the ion coating process on the target. The layers of the coating ions were classified based on the ion range and the ions density distribution as the coating layer, the mixed layer and the basement layer. The model could be used to predict the thickness of the mixed layer and the ion intensity in the coating layer for the given ion energy. The time needed to create the mixed and the coating layers with the desired thickness and density could also be calculated.",10.14457/cu.the.2008.1583,Crystal lattices|โครงสร้างผลึก|ions|สนามไฟฟ้า|Electric fields|ไอออน,,,,2008-01-01,nrct.db1,Three dimensional simulation for implantation with ions from plasma source,,

In the study, we applied the computational pipeline of molecular docking followed by the molecular dynamics simulations to shortlist potential βdGT protein targets. The analysis of protein dynamics and the binding free energy (ΔG) led us to the identification of HK4 as a key βdGT target, whereby the binding mode and domain dynamics suggested the activator function of βdGT. βdGT bound to the allosteric site of the isozyme ∼13 Å away from the substrate (glucose)-binding site. The binding free energy of the ligand-protein complex was energetically feasible (ΔG, –41.61 kcal/mol) and the cleft angle deviation between the two (small and large) domains of HK4 revealed differential HK4 dynamics in response to βdGT binding. 3D structure analysis of the isozyme-ligand complex highlighted the role of Arg63, Glu67 and Lys458 in ligand stabilization and hydrophobic interactions mediated by Tyr214 and Met235. Experimental validation of the results of computational analysis confirmed the activator function of βdGT on HK4.

Snow leopards exhibited low genetic diversity at microsatellites (AN = 5.8, HO = 0.433, HE = 0.568), virtually no mtDNA variation, and underwent a bottleneck in the Holocene (~8,000 years ago) coinciding with increased temperatures, precipitation, and upward treeline shift in the Tibetan Plateau.

Accordingly, we recognize three subspecies, P. u. irbis (Northern group), P. u. uncia (Western group), and P. u. uncioides (Central group) based upon genetic distinctness, low levels of admixture, unambiguous population assignment, and geographic separation. The patterns of variation were consistent with desert-basin ""barrier effects"" of the Gobi isolating the northern subspecies (Mongolia), and the trans-Himalaya dividing the central (Qinghai, Tibet, Bhutan, and Nepal) and western subspecies (India, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan). Hierarchical Bayesian clustering analysis revealed additional subdivision into a minimum of six proposed management units: western Mongolia, southern Mongolia, Tian Shan, Pamir-Himalaya, Tibet-Himalaya, and Qinghai, with spatial autocorrelation suggesting potential connectivity by dispersing individuals up to ~ 400 km. We provide a foundation for global conservation of snow leopard subspecies, and set the stage for in-depth landscape genetics and genomic studies.",10.5061/dryad.sb20c,genetics|snow leopard|microsatellite|Conservation genetics and biodiversity|Population structure and phylogeography|subspecies|phylogeography,Policy and Management|Snow Leopard Conservancy|Institute of General and Experimental Biology|University of California|Duquesne University|Environment and Protection|Chinese Academy of Forestry|Department of Environmental Science|Trinity College|Kathmandu|American Museum of Natural History|Irbis Mongolia|Baltistan Wildlife Conservation and Development Organization|Department of Biological Sciences|Key Laboratory of Forest Ecology and Environment of State Forestry Administration|Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology|Panthera|Peking University|College of Life Sciences|Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology|University of Montana|Center for Molecular Dynamics|Center for Nature and Society|Bhutan Foundation|Snow Leopard Trust|Texas AandM University|Department of Biology|College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences|Institute of Forest Ecology|University of Adelaide|Shan Shui Conservation Center|Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences|Wildlife Biology Program|Mongolian Academy of Sciences,Panthera uncia,,2017-04-28,DRYAD,Data from: Range-wide snow leopard phylogeography supports three subspecies,,

Thus, NS3/4A and both wild-type (WT) and H274Y mutant of NA subtypes H5N1 and pH1N1 were focused. Initially, NS3/4A binding to the current inhibitors (boceprevir, telaprevir, danoprevir as well as NA bound with laninamivir were studied in order to investigate their binding pattern and ligand-target interactions as well as the binding efficiency using the conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The per-residue decomposition energy was calculated by molecular mechanics (MM)/generalized Born surface area (GBSA) indicating that the residues 41-43, 57, 81, 136-139, 155-159 and 168 of NS3/4A and 118-119, 151-152, 178, 224, 227, 276, 292 and 371 of all 4 NAs are the key binding residues. Van der Waals interaction is the main contribution to NS3/4A protease inhibitors binding, whereas the main contribution stabilized laninamivir binding is electrostatic interaction. Since some side effects have been observed in patients who treated by approved anti-HCV drugs, the new potent NS3/4A inhibitors have been needed. Therefore the potent inhibitors against NS3/4A were searched from the collected 40 ZINC ligands using steered MD technique based on the hypothesis that the high rupture force is needed for the high efficiency ligand. It was found that 9 top-hit compounds were probably good as or better than the 4 current NS3/4A inhibitors. Based on the SCC-DFTB/MM MD simulation, the acylation step of NS3/4A binding to beceprevir and telaprevir was occurred in the concerted manner as same as the native substrates which their energy barriers for the backward reaction of both systems were 19-23 kcal/mol approximately.

We have developed a numerical model for simulating the dynamics of gas molecules evolved from aerosol particles. The simulation model is composed of two main sections. The first section simulates the elastic collisions of the evolved gas molecules in a small region near the vaporization source (collision domain), where the mean free paths of the molecules are much shorter than those in the surrounding high vacuum environment. The second section simulates the free-molecular dynamics from the boundary of the first section to the ionizer.

Nuclear dynamics plays a critical role in understanding the experimental data and cannot be excluded from consideration. Solving the nuclear problem at the same level as the electronic part can be solved is prohibitively expensive with the current computational tools even for small molecules.; The focus of the work presented in this thesis is on filling the gap between advanced ab initio techniques and state of the art experiments by creative use of simple models and approximations for nuclear dynamics to interpret the observed data. A brief overview of the methods is given in Chapter 1.; In Chapters 2-4 we discuss the effect of a high molecular symmetry on the topology of the potential energy surfaces. In particular, the difference between conical and glancing intersections, and how both types of intersections shape the photoelectron spectra and the dissociation dynamics.

Among the different brain structures investigated for localization of memory formation, such as hippocampus and amygdala, the cerebellum has been widely accepted as serving the neural basis for classical eyeblink conditioning. A growing body of evidence suggests that both cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei contribute to learning and memory of eyeblink conditioning. In this study, the role of the mammalian cerebellum was extensively examined in a novel mice model system with Purkinje cell deficiency. Glucose-regulated protein (GRP, 78kDa) conditional knockout mice demonstrated impaired learning with aberrant timing and amplitude of the conditioned response, and the interpositus nucleus was found to be crucial for expression of conditioned response. In addition, the molecular mechanism of cerebellar learning was investigated using immediate-early gene protein detection in the rat cerebellum following a single training session of eyeblink conditioning. c-Fos protein, a regulatory transcription factor, was detected in the Purkinje cells of the rat cerebellum perfused 1 hour after the onset of training. Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) was significantly increased in the cerebellar cortex when compared to naïve or pseudoconditioned animals. Also, Stargazin expression was increased following training, which reinforces the notion that Stargazin is required for synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Together, these studies extend previous findings of the role of cerebellum and the molecular dynamics underlying the establishment of memory trace in the mammalian cerebellum.",10.25549/usctheses-m2982,Neuroscience|learning and memory|classical eyeblink conditioning,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Classical eyeblink conditioning: the role of the cerebellum and its molecular bases,,

The hard knock-on and soft knock-on models, which rely on different water and ion configurations, have been offered as competing theories of ion coordination. In order to study the mechanism of selective ion permeation, the bacterial potassium-selective ion channel, KcsA, was used in the investigation described in this thesis. Molecular dynamics was employed using a novel, dynamic approach with constant velocity pulling. In the set-up, two potassium are pulled through the selectivity filter at fifteen discrete ion separation distances in both inward and outward directions to generate a free-energy profile, or two-dimensional potentials of mean force (2D PMF). The energetics of the pathway are calculated using analysis methods that call upon using weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) equations and the Minh-Adib (MA) bidirectional estimator to determine the mechanism of permeation. The constant velocity procedure is replicated with the replacement of one potassium ion for a sodium ion to generate a second 2D PMF profile, such that the mechanism of ion selectivity may be revealed by comparison of the two 2D PMF profiles. Other parameters of the simulations are then explored, drawing from the dynamical nature of the approach, to better understand how the channel operates.

 In the present article an interactive simulation program illustrating grain boundary and fracture phenomena in solids is described. The dynamical behaviour of a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones model system under stress, with either a grain boundary or an initial crack, is simulated through a molecular dynamics algorithm. All parameters defining the system and the dynamical load are set through a graphical user interface. A run-time representation of the system is displayed on a graphics window,...

 Nature of problem 
 In a typical research activity involving simulations of complex physical systems, one is often faced with a 'research loop', which may be loosely described as follows: definition of input data; running of a simulation, outputting data to a storage disk; post-processing of the accumulated data for extracting relevant information with the eventual aid of graphics and numerical packages; definition of new input parameters and, closing the loop, starting a new simulation run. Advances in computer ha ...

We present an adaptive Bayesian inference method for automating the training of interpretable, low-dimensional, and multi-element interatomic force fields using structures drawn on the fly from molecular dynamics simulations. Within an active learning framework, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to accept the model prediction or to perform a first principles calculation to augment the training set of the model. The method is applied to a range of single- and multi-element systems and shown to achieve a favorable balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, while requiring a minimal amount of ab initio training data.

While adaptation to constant environments has been well characterized, the effects of environmental complexity remain seldom studied. One simple but understudied factor is the rate of environmental change. Here we used experimental evolution with RNA viruses to investigate whether evolutionary dynamics varied based on the rate of environmental turnover. We used whole-genome next-generation sequencing to characterize evolutionary dynamics in virus populations adapting to a sudden versus gradual shift onto a novel host cell type. In support of theoretical models, we found that when populations evolved in response to a sudden environmental change, mutations of large beneficial effect tended to fix early, followed by mutations of smaller beneficial effect; as predicted, this pattern broke down in response to a gradual environmental change. Early mutational steps were highly parallel across replicate populations in both treatments.

Second, we have developed a novel parallelization framework for finite-difference time-domain applications. The approach is validated in a seismic-wave propagation simulation code on BlueGene/L, BlueGene/P and x86 quad-core processor based clusters. In addition, we have developed strategies for in-core optimization of the algorithmic kernel of this application, which is a high-order stencil computation--a common kernel to a spectrum of finite-differences based applications.

A scalable parallel MD algorithm incorporating first principles-based reactive force fields (ReaxFF) has been implemented to perform multimillion-to-billion atom chemically reactive MD simulations.; Mechanical stimuli in energetic materials initiate chemical reactions at shock fronts prior to detonation. Multimillion-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations are performed to investigate atomistic mechanisms of shock-induced reaction initiation in 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) crystal. The simulation reveals a bi-modal molecular response against a planar shock loading, which creates a nanoscale layered-structure of molecular dipole behind a shock front.; The sensitivity of energetic crystals changes with defects such as voids, grain boundaries and cracks. By performing million-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations, the effects of microstructures in crystal on shock sensitivity have been investigated. MD simulation reveals the formation of a nanojet which focuses into a narrow beam as the void collapses. By increasing particle velocity, a pinning-depinning transition of the shock wave front at the void occurs. Shock loading simulation in a nanophase RDX crystal reveals a deformation mechanism that is mediated by molecular reorientation and conformation changes. Molecular rotation and deformation significantly reduce the energy barrier for the onset of slip.; In contrast to crystalline solids, damage, flow and fracture in glass are still controversial areas. We have performed multimillion-atom MD simulations to investigate initiation and growth of wing cracks in confined silica glass. Under dynamic compression, frictional sliding of precrack surfaces nucleates nanovoids which evolve into nanocrack columns at the precrack tip. Nanocrack columns merge to form a wing crack, which grows via coalescence with nanovoids in the direction of maximum compression.; Multimillion-to-billion-atom MD simulations are performed on nanovoid array under hydrostatic tension. Nanocavities nucleate in intervoid ligaments as a result of the expansion of Si-O rings due to a bond-switching mechanism, which involves bond breaking between Si-O and bond formation between that Si and a nonbridging O. With further increase in strain, nanocracks form on void surfaces and ligaments fracture through the growth and coalescence of ligament nanocavities.",10.25549/usctheses-m1240,deformation|energetic materials|molecular dynamics|silica glass|Physics|fracture,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Shock sensitivity of energetic material and nanometric damage mechanisms in silica glass,,

In E. coli, SurA comprises three domains: a core domain and two peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains (P1 and P2). The functional roles of these domains in chaperone activity, including their inter-subunit dynamics and interactions with substrates remain unclear. Here we have used chemical cross-linking, HDX-MS, oxidative labelling, single-molecule FRET and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the conformational dynamics of SurA in its apo state and to map the binding site(s) for its clients. We demonstrate that SurA predominantly samples conformations in solution in which the P2 domain is closer to the core and P1 domains than suggested by the extended conformation in its crystal structure. Using cross-linking experiments we show that SurA has multiple, yet specific, binding sites for OmpX located primarily in the core domain, and that residues spanning the whole OmpX sequence bind in these regions. HDX experiments additionally reveal that binding of OmpX, and the larger client OmpF, lead to inter-domain conformational changes between the core and P1 domains. Combining these data we generate a model for SurA OMP recognition in which unfolded OMP substrates bind in a cradle formed between the SurA domains, in a manner reminiscent of other ATP-independent chaperones. Structural flexibility between domains is likely a key feature of the SurA functional cycle, assisting in OMP recognition, binding and release of its broad range of OMP substrates for folding into the outer membrane.",10.5518/701,C000,,,,2020-01-01,bl.leeds,Inter-domain dynamics in the chaperone SurA and multi-site binding to its outer membrane protein clients - dataset,,

 Nature of problem 
 Continuum methods are often incapable of resolving features and flow patterns in confined nanoscale liquid flows. Macroscopic simulations are far out of reach of atomistic simulations. Combining the atomistic resolution of molecular dynamics with the reduced computational expense of traditional continuum numerical techniques for fluid flow would allow larger scale problems to be studied.

Meanwhile, the performance of computing hardware grows through increasingly heterogeneous parallelism, enabling simulations of ever more complex models.

This bottleneck can be alleviated by intermediate software layers that provide higher-level abstractions closer to the problem domain, reducing development times and allowing computational scientists to focus. Here, we present OpenFPM, an open and scalable framework that provides an abstraction layer for numerical simulations using particles and/or meshes. OpenFPM provides transparent and scalable infrastructure for shared-memory and distributed-memory implementations of particles-only and hybrid particle-mesh simulations of both discrete and continuous models, as well as non-simulation codes.

Presently, the structure-function properties governing the ferroelectric behavior of RP perovskites are an open question.

Extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations support the experimental results and identified correlated reorientation of MA molecules and ion translations as the source of ferroelectricity.

One of the most widely used ceramics is alumina, a candidate for armor in defense and aerospace industry. Deformation and fracture mechanisms in alpha-alumina under hypervelocity impact up to 18km/s are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations containing 540-million atoms. Impacting projectile causes melting and local amorphization of the substrate in a spherical surrounding region. Away from the impact face, a wide range of deformations emerge and disappear under the influence of local stress fields, e.g., basal and pyramidal slips, basal and rhombohedral twins, which show good agreement with the experimental and theoretical results. Furthermore, new deformation modes such as twin along {0-111} are observed, and the relation between deformation patterns and local stress levels are probed. During unloading, micro-cracks nucleate extensively at the intersections of previous deformations. These micro-cracks grow and coalesce to form fractures under tensile stresses by the unloading wave. The substrate eventually fails along the surface of an hourglass-shaped region, when spallation ejects clusters of substrate material into the vacuum. We also carried out planar shock simulations of alpha-alumina single crystal and nanophase systems. The results show correlations between the atomistic deformation mechanisms and the elastic-plastic response of ceramic material observed in shock loading experiments.",10.25549/usctheses-m791,alpha-alumina|Materials Science|hypervelocity impact|deformation mechanisms|fracture mechanisms,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Hypervelocity impact damage in alumina,,

As the crystal grows, the solute molecules are drawn from the solution to the crystal, leading to a continuous drop in the solution concentration. This is in contrast to experiments in which the crystal grows at an approximately constant supersaturation of a bulk solution. Recently, Perego et al. [J. Chem. Phys.2015, 142, 144113] showed that in a periodic setup in which the crystal is represented as a slab, the concentration in the vicinity of the two surfaces can be kept constant while the molecules are drawn from a part of the solution that acts as a molecular reservoir. This method is quite effective in studying crystallization under controlled supersaturation conditions. However, once the reservoir is depleted, the constant supersaturation conditions cannot be maintained. We propose a variant of this method to tackle this depletion problem by simultaneously dissolving one side of the crystal while letting the other side grow. A continuous supply of particles to the solution due to the crystal dissolution maintains a steady solution concentration and avoids reservoir depletion. In this way, a constant supersaturation condition can be maintained for as long as necessary. We have applied this method to study the growth and dissolution of urea crystal from water solution under constant supersaturation and undersaturation conditions, respectively.

Based on the functional role, 36 and 83 genes that are involved in biofilm formation of A. baumannii and P. areugenosa respectively were selected and metabolic network was computationally constructed. The genes that lack three-dimensional structures were predicted and validated. Carbon nano-fullerene selected as lead molecule and their drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetics properties were computationally predicted. The binding potential of carbon nano-fullerene toward selected drug targets was modeled and compared with the binding of conventional drugs, doripenem, and polymyxin-B with their usual targets. The stabilities of four best-docked complexes were confirmed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. This study suggested that selected genes demonstrated relevant interactions in the constructed metabolic pathways. Carbon fullerene exhibited significant binding abilities to most of the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of last-resort antibiotics and their usual target. The four best ligand–receptor interactions predicted by molecular docking revealed that stability throughout MD simulation. Notably, carbon fullerene exhibited profound binding with outer membrane protein (OmpA) and ribonuclease-HII (rnhB) of A. baumannii and 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone synthase (pqsBC) and chemotaxis protein (wspA) of P. aeruginosa. Thus, the current study suggested that carbon fullerene was probably used as potential lead molecules toward selected targets of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa and the applied aspects probably scaled up to design promising lead molecules toward these pathogens.

,"Henke, Paul S.",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-190494,DATASET,,"Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is a ubiquitous, highly functional biomolecule found throughout life. As a polyelectrolyte, RNA is negatively charged and requires the presence of positive counterions to condense into the specific, folded structures that are necessary for the chemistry of life. RNA molecules are especially influenced by divalent metal ions such as Mg²⁺, the presence of which not only helps to neutralize the RNA, but creates an overall attractive free energy—an important effect not found under simple monovalent salt conditions. ❧ Methods of modeling ionic and polyionic systems date back to the early 20th century, when Peter Debye and Erich Hückel developed their purely analytical, Poisson-Boltzmann formalism of electrolytes that persists as the primary model used for most theoretical applications. However, the Debye-Hückel model breaks down when considering highly correlated polyions such as nucleic acids, as well as divalent and other high-valence ionic solutions in concentrations similar to those found in vivo. The theoretical limits of the Debye-Hückel model in tandem with the rise of simulation and numerical methods for studying biological systems has led to a need for alternative models of polyelectrolyte systems that will correctly account for complex ionic conditions while simultaneously allowing for calculations fast enough to be incorporated into simulation. ❧ In this thesis, we study the interaction between RNA and positive counterions, focusing specifically on divalent cations. We begin with a discussion the structure and function of RNA, and we cover new research showing that RNA has more functionality and biochemically relevant applications than ever previously thought. This is followed by a recap of prior theoretical studies and models of electrolyte and polyelectrolyte systems—both for RNAs specifically as well as general models. We then present our own model for RNA-ion interactions, which allows us to calculate the counterion-mediated free energy of RNA, but only through an NP-complete optimization problem. A heuristic approach to this NP-complete problem is developed, which is shown to work very well for all functional RNAs smaller than the ribosome, and is computationally fast and effective enough to be incorporated into full simulation. Monte Carlo simulations of RNA are run with our implicit divalent ion model incorporated, and we show that our model matches closely with experiment. Most biomolecular simulation is done via molecular dynamics methodology, and to account for this, we further develop our numerical approach so that ensemble forces may be calculated and incorporated into molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we develop a full coarse-grained model of RNA that accurately handles the attractive electrostatic forces generated by the presence of divalent counterions, and use this model to simulate and study RNA 2-way junctions.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-190494,counterions|coarse graining|RNA|Monte Carlo|Mg²⁺|simulation|molecular dynamics|Physics|divalent ions,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,The effects of divalent counterions on the formation and stabilization of RNA tertiary structure,,
,"Piroozan, Nariman",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-143591,DATASET,,"Friction is an essential part of human experience, as it is a key component in our ability to gain traction to walk, stand, work and drive, and also save energy. While friction is certainly a necessary phenomenon, it presents one glaring problem. We need energy to overcome the resistance to motion that is caused by frictional forces, and too much of it causes excess cost, increased energy to perform work and, therefore, increased inefficiencies as well. It is the purpose of this Thesis, then, to present an advance towards two interconnected objectives in this regard. The first is a better understanding of the mechanical and energetic precursors that give rise to friction and, then, to present applicable results in this regard. These objectives are studied in this Thesis, including the tribological properties of silicon carbide, a material commonly used in high-temperature conditions, and the superlubric properties of graphene, an excellent solid lubricant, and its behavior coupled with a series of precious metals. The final chapter will study friction between sandstone surfaces, represented by quartz, one of the most common terrestrial minerals, and its frictional properties at subseismic sliding conditions. ❧ Sliding friction between two SiC surfaces is important, due to its relevance to many practical applications. It is also important to study whether kinetic friction at the nanoscale follows Coulomb's law. Since SiC exists both as an amorphous material and with a crystalline structure, the effect of surface roughness on the kinetic friction may also be significant. We report the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulation of sliding friction between surfaces of the two types of SiC over a wide range of sliding velocities. The amorphous SiC was generated by the reactive force field ReaxFF, which was also used to represent the interaction potential for the simulation of sliding friction. As the sliding velocity increases, bond breaking occurs at the interface between the two surfaces, leading to their roughening and formation of excess free volume. They reduce the kinetic friction force, hence resulting in decreasing the difference between kinetic friction in the amorphous and crystalline surfaces. The average kinetic friction force depends nonlinearly on the sliding velocity V, implying that Coulomb's law of friction is not satisfied by the surfaces that we study at the nanoscale. The average kinetic friction force Fₖ depends on V as, Fₖ ∝ ln V. ❧ The state of extremely low friction, known as superlubricity, has very important applications to the development of various types of materials, including those that are invaluable to the goal of reducing energy loss in mechanical systems, and those in complex gearing and bearing systems. One material that can produce very low friction is graphene that offers distinct properties as a solid-state lubricant, and can potentially be used as a coating material on surfaces. We have carried out extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to study and compute the friction force between a graphene nanoribbon and an inert metal surface. The metal surfaces that we study are those of Au, Ag, and Pt, all of which are used in various instruments, as well as in various materials employed in the industry. Consistent with very recent experiments, the Au-graphene system exhibits superlubricity, but the Ag-graphene and Pt-graphene pairs manifest friction forces higher than that of Au-graphene, although they are still very small. The MD simulations indicate that the average friction force for graphene on an Au surface is approximately 1.5 pN, with the corresponding values being about 6 pN and 11 pN for, respectively, Ag and Pt surfaces. ❧ The frictional behavior of faults during seismic events, such as earthquakes, is a topic of profound importance. The experimentally-observed degradation of shear strengths in silicate rocks has been hypothesized to emanate from the phenomenon of “flash heating.” Using extensive MD simulations, we study this phenomenon at interstitial asperities for quartz crystals and present extensive results on the mechanical and thermal evolution of the material under shearing and various sliding velocities. Furthermore, we also present the evolution as a function of varying the thickness of the two layers sliding with respect to each other. We discover that with an increase in the sliding velocity, the frequency and intensity of flash heating events increase as well. This in turn destabilizes the crystalline structure at the interface between opposing quartz layers, forming an amorphous layer. At low slip rates, the heat generated is able to diffuse away appreciably through the material, resulting in a small temperature rise and, therefore, weak effect on the overall strength of the material. At higher slip rates, however, there is not enough time for the heat generated at the interface to dissipate. This in turn causes an increase in the overall interstitial temperature, which in turn causes decreased material strength, followed by sharply reduced frictional resistance.",10.25549/usctheses-c89-143591,computational physics|Chemical Engineering|molecular dynamics|tribology,,,,2019-01-01,usc.dl,Molecular-scale studies of mechanical phenomena at the interface between two solid surfaces: from high performance friction to superlubricity and flash heating,,

TcRpiB residues, such as Cys69, Asp45, Glu149 and Pro47, have confirmed their roles in substrate recognition, catalytic reaction and binding site conformation. However, the joint performance of His11 and His102, in the D-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) in the catalysis is not well understood. In this work, we probed the influence of different protonation states of His11 and His102 on the behavior of the ligand R5P using molecular dynamics simulations, network analysis and thermodynamic integration. Simulations revealed that a protonated His11 combined with a neutral His102 (His11+‒His102) was able to stabilize the ligand R5P in the binding site. Moreover, calculated relative free energy differences showed that when protonated His11 was coupled to a neutral His102 an exergonic process takes place. On the other hand, neutral His11 combined with a protonated His102 (His11‒His102+), sampled conformations that resembled the catalyzed product D-ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P). Network analysis also demonstrated some peculiarities for these systems with some negatively correlated nodes in the binding site for His11‒His102+, and exclusive suboptimal paths for His11+‒His102. Therefore, the combined approach presented in this paper proposes two suitable protonation states for the TcRpiB catalytic mechanism, where an extra proton in either histidines might favor R5P binding or influence isomerization reaction to Ru5P. Our results may guide further in silico drug discovery studies.

There has been a resulting development of reconfigurable computers that have microprocessors, reconfigurable hardware, and high-performance interconnect. We address several aspects of accelerating scientific computing applications with reconfigurable hardware and reconfigurable computers.; Because there is no native support on reconfigurable hardware for the floating-point arithmetic needed by many scientific computing applications, we introduce a library of double-precision floating-point cores and analyze the effects on performance of the degree of pipelining and the implemented features of IEEE standard 754. Scientific computing applications may spend a large amount of time evaluating arithmetic expressions. Hence, we present area-efficient designs for arithmetic expression evaluation that hide the pipeline latencies of floating-point cores. These designs use at most two cores for each type of operator in the expression and have better area and throughput properties than designs generated by a state-of-the-art hardware compiler for FPGAs. Experiments show that for 64- and 1024-input expressions, area increases linearly with the number of types of operators.; Implementing a design on a reconfigurable computer can be difficult and is not guaranteed to give a speed-up. We thus formulate hierarchical architectural and performance models for reconfigurable computers that facilitate performance prediction early in the design process. The performance model has errors of 5% to 13% in our work in accelerating molecular dynamics. A hierarchical programming model for developing and modeling implementations of scientific computing applications on reconfigurable computers is also provided.; To demonstrate acceleration of a complete scientific computing application, we study molecular dynamics on reconfigurable computers. We investigate single-node, shifted-force simulations; single-node, particle-mesh-Ewald simulations; and multinode, shifted-force simulations. We attain 2x to 3x speed-ups over state-of-the-art microprocessors through a hardware/software approach in which the most intensive task executes on reconfigurable hardware and the rest of the tasks execute on the microprocessor. In the particle-mesh-Ewald simulation, we exploit parallelism between the microprocessor and the reconfigurable hardware.

Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to show that an amphiphilic NP can reach the bilayer midplane non-disruptively if charged ligands iteratively ``flip'' across the bilayer. Ligand flipping is a favorable process that relaxes bilayer curvature, decreases the nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area of the NP monolayer, and increases attractive ligand-lipid electrostatic interactions. Analysis of end group hydration further indicates that iterative ligand flipping can occur on experimentally relevant timescales. Supported by these results, we present a complete energy landscape for the non-disruptive insertion of amphiphilic NPs into lipid bilayers. These findings will help guide the design of NPs to enhance bilayer insertion and non-endocytic cellular uptake, and also provide physical insight into a possible pathway for the translocation of charged biomacromolecules.",10.5061/dryad.3r0h560,,,,,2019-01-10,DRYAD,Data from: Energy landscape for the insertion of amphiphilic nanoparticles into lipid membranes: a computational study,,

The deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 21A2), an enzyme involved in cortisol synthesis, is responsible for ∼95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This metabolic disease exhibits three clinical forms: salt-wasting, simple virilizing, and non-classical form, which are divided according to the degree of severity. In the present study, structural and mutational analyses were performed in order to identify the structural impact of mutations on cytochrome P450 21A2 and correlate them with patient clinical severity. The following mutations were selected: arginine-356 to tryptophan (R356W), proline-30 to leucine (P30L), isoleucine-172 to asparagine (I172N), valine-281 to leucine (V281L), and the null mutation glutamine-318 (Q318X). Our computational approach mapped the location of residues on P450 and identified their implications on enzyme electrostatic potential mapping to progesterone and heme binding pockets. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the structural stability of ligand binding and protein structure, as well as possible conformational changes at the catalytic pocket that leads to impairment of enzymatic activity.

The results derived from MD simulations of the complex between DV NS2B/NS3 protease and the tetra-peptidic inhibitor as well as with small-molecule inhibitors revealed that residues at the C-terminus of NS2B (Asp81-Ser85), at the S1 pocket (Leu128-Thr134 of NS3), His51, Asp75, Ser135, Gly151, Asn152, Gly153 and Tyr161 of NS3 are important for inhibitor interaction. Results also demonstrated that NS2B is important for stabilizing the binding pocket of NS3 as well as for stabilzing the binding of the tetra-peptidic inhibitor. A stepwise virtual screening (VS) for DV NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors was carried out by combining pharmacophore and molecular docking-based screening with subsequent binding free energy calculation.

 GFCUBHEX is a program that calculates Green's tensor function and displacement fields for a point force in cubic and hexagonal crystals based on an exact single integral solution (Synge, 1957). Linear interpolation between grid points is used to speed up calculations of the orientation-dependent part of the Green's function. The program can be used to calculate the Green's function and the displacement field in atomistic simulations with an arbitrary choice of orthogonal coordinate system. ...

 Nature of problem 
 In linear elasticity theory, displacement fields caused by a point force pattern can be expressed by the elastic Green's tensor function for an infinite medium. It can be calculated using an exact single integral solution [1]. However, the exact calculation is prohibitively expensive for molecular dynamics simulations.

Functional deficiency of tyrosinase results in serious dermatological diseases. Tyrosinase also participates in neuromelanin formation in the human brain, which leads to neurodegeneration resulting in Parkinson’s disease. In fruits and vegetables, tyrosinase plays a critical role in senescence, causing undesired browning that results in faster deterioration and shorter shelf lines. The only commercially available tyrosinase is mushroom tyrosinase and it shows the highest homology to the mammalian tyrosinase. Although kojic acid is currently used as a tyrosinase inhibitor, they have serious side effects such as dermatitis, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to develop a more active and safer tyrosinase inhibitor, 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were generated based on experimentally known inhibitors. The pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with a large cost difference, high correlation coefficient and low RMS deviation.

Functional deficiency of tyrosinase results in serious dermatological diseases. Tyrosinase also participates in neuromelanin formation in the human brain, which leads to neurodegeneration resulting in Parkinson’s disease. In fruits and vegetables, tyrosinase plays a critical role in senescence, causing undesired browning that results in faster deterioration and shorter shelf lines. The only commercially available tyrosinase is mushroom tyrosinase and it shows the highest homology to the mammalian tyrosinase. Although kojic acid is currently used as a tyrosinase inhibitor, they have serious side effects such as dermatitis, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to develop a more active and safer tyrosinase inhibitor, 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were generated based on experimentally known inhibitors. The pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with a large cost difference, high correlation coefficient and low RMS deviation.

The deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 21A2), an enzyme involved in cortisol synthesis, is responsible for ∼95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This metabolic disease exhibits three clinical forms: salt-wasting, simple virilizing, and non-classical form, which are divided according to the degree of severity. In the present study, structural and mutational analyses were performed in order to identify the structural impact of mutations on cytochrome P450 21A2 and correlate them with patient clinical severity. The following mutations were selected: arginine-356 to tryptophan (R356W), proline-30 to leucine (P30L), isoleucine-172 to asparagine (I172N), valine-281 to leucine (V281L), and the null mutation glutamine-318 (Q318X). Our computational approach mapped the location of residues on P450 and identified their implications on enzyme electrostatic potential mapping to progesterone and heme binding pockets. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the structural stability of ligand binding and protein structure, as well as possible conformational changes at the catalytic pocket that leads to impairment of enzymatic activity.

Domains have been observed in species ranging from bacteria to humans and are thought to play an important role in gene regulation. Yet the mechanisms of domain formation are not fully understood. Here we use computer simulations to investigate domain formation in yeast. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed domains using only nucleosome positioning information as an input, implying that (unlike in higher eukaryotes) domain boundary locations are largely determined at this level.

One approach is designed to inhibit entry of HIV into host cells, with a target being the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Polyanionic compounds have been shown to be effective in inhibiting HIV entry, with a mechanism involving electrostatic interactions with the V3 loop of gp120 being proposed. In this study, we applied computational methods to elucidate molecular interactions between the repeat unit of the precisely alternating polyanion, Poly(4,4′-stilbenedicarboxylate-alt–maleic acid) (DCSti-alt-MA) and the V3 loop of gp120 from strains of HIV against which these polyanions were previously tested (IIIb, BaL, 92UG037, JR-CSF) as well as two strains for which gp120 crystal structures are available (YU2, 2B4C). Homology modeling was used to create models of the gp120 proteins. Using monomers of the gp120 protein, we applied extensive molecular dynamics simulations to obtain dominant morphologies that represent a variety of open-closed states of the V3 loop to examine the interaction of 112 ligands of the repeating units of DCSti-alt-MA docked to the V3 loop and surrounding residues. Using the distance between the V1/V2 and V3 loops of gp120 as a metric, we revealed through MD simulations that gp120 from the lab-adapted strains (BaL and IIIb), which are more susceptible to inhibition by DCSti-alt-MA, clearly transitioned to the closed state in one replicate of each simulation set, whereas none of the replicates from the Tier II strains (92UG037 and JR-CSF) did so. Docking repeat unit microspecies to the gp120 protein before and after MD simulation enabled identification of residues that were key for binding. Notably, only a few residues were found to be important for docking both before and after MD simulation as a result of the conformational heterogeneity provided by the simulations. Consideration of the residues that were consistently involved in interactions with the ligand revealed the importance of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties of the ligand for effective binding. The results also suggest that polymers of DCSti-alt-MA with repeating units of different configurations may have advantages for therapeutic efficacy.",10.7294/w49s1p7v,,,,,2017-01-01,viva.vt,Computational Study of HIV gp120 as a Target for Polyanionic Entry Inhibitors: Exploiting the V3 Loop Region,,

It also allows automatic job submission and result collection on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools, including Slurm, PBS, and LSF.

In this way, in a single molecular dynamics simulation, we are able to compute the liquid-solid coexistence line for entire regions of the temperature and pressure phase diagram.

The loading capacity of gemcitabine drug inside single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) cavity was subsequently studied by molecular dynamics (MD).

The selective inhibition of WNK1 over other isoforms has created an immense challenge in the design of an ATP competitive inhibitor due to their high conservatism. In this work, we have compared the selectivity of the inhibitor WNK463, which was designed for WNK1 with other WNK family isoforms by comprehensive molecular modeling, docking and molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method. Our calculations show that the affinity of the inhibitor decreases in the order WNK2 &gt; WNK1 &gt; WNK3 &gt; WNK4, in agreement with the experiment. Our study reveals that the inhibitor is most selective to WNK2 due to decreased polar solvation and configurational entropy compared to other isoforms. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the nonpolar contribution from the hydrophobic residues and hydrogen bonds in the hinge region gatekeeper residue Met304 of WNK1 and its equivalent residue from other kinases played a critical role in stabilizing the inhibitor against WNK kinases. Residues Lys233, Met304, Phe356 and Leu369 of WNK1 were the essential residue differences compared to other isoforms that led to specific interactions thereby forming the basis of molecular binding pattern of binding interactions. Overall, we have identified conserved WNK-inhibitor interactions and elucidated isoform-specific interactions that could be exploited in the design of more potent and selective WNK inhibitors.

Abstract 
We have extended the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) to support directional bonds and dynamic bonding. The framework supports stochastic formation of new bonds, breakage of existing bonds, and conversion between bond types. Bond formation can be controlled to limit the maximal functionality of a bead with respect to various bond types. Concomitant with the bond dynamics, angular and dihedral interactions are dynamically introduced between newly connected tri...

,"Frazier, Zachary C.",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-198976,DATASET,,"Cellular processes take place over relatively large temporal and spatial scales. Molecular interactions mediate structural changes in proteins and their complexes, which modulate their activities, and      regulate complex processes, including cellular transport of components across membranes, gene expression, and genome replication. Gaining knowledge of these systems requires experimental techniques that     span the temporal and spatial scales of the environment, ranging from the atomic description of the individual components to knowledge about the detailed locations of all of its components at the cell        level. The cellular environment is complex, teeming with thousands of molecular structures in a dynamic equilibrium. ❧ Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) is an emerging technology which provides some unique advantages in the study of structural organization of entire cells. The samples are lightly processed in a close to native state, essentially providing a snapshot of the interior composition of cells. In principle, samples used in cryoET provide information about the spatial organization of the cell, allowing researchers to detect the structures of objects the size of protein complexes, as well as their relative orientation, abundance, and interactions. With a dynamic environment, these values provide insight into the functionality of a cell's components. However, extracting this information is challenging due to the relatively low resolution, low signal-to-noise ratio, and distortions in the tomograms due to missing data. ❧ Cryo-ET provides a 3-dimensional density of the volume under study. Segmentation of the volume based on regions of high density allows the identification of individual protein complexes, as well as larger structures. These can be compared to known structures, or against each other to classify them into groups whose density maps can be averaged to increase their resolution. This large scale analysis is computationally intensive, demanding expansive resources. Here we describe the TomoMiner package, a parallel computing framework for these calculations. The software runs on computer clusters with hundreds of processors and can handle the alignment, clustering, and averaging of hundreds of thousands of subtomograms. After recovering detailed data regarding the interior of cells, one approach to understanding  the dynamics of the system is modeling the reaction-diffusion behavior of all its components. At the scale of entire cells containing an abundance of protein complexes, atomic modeling is too detailed and would require too many steps in order to model large scale processes.Brownian dynamics (BD) allows the abstraction of the smallest molecules in the simulation, and allows for the simulation of larger temporal steps than molecular dynamics.  Brownian dynamics simulations still have restrictions based on reaction and diffusion rates, which limit the scope of the time steps available in the simulations. We have developed an approach to accelerate Brownian dynamics simulations specifically tailored for simulating the reaction-diffusion process of crowded mixtures of proteins. The approach removes constraints due to fast reaction rates that require small temporal steps for diffusion limited reactions. The only remaining constraints on BD simulations are those required by physical constraints and limitations. The new algorithm for BD simulations accurately reproduce reactions and dynamics of cellular scale systems with temporal step increases over existing approaches, allowing for simulations at cellular time scales. These two contributions, a package for discovering features at the cellular scale of real environments, and the ability to accurately simulate the environment more efficiently, provide researchers with techniques for accelerated discovery at the cellular scale.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-198976,computational biology|reaction-diffusion|chemical kinetics|Brownian dynamics|tomography|Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|cryo-electron tomography,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Computational analysis of the spatial and temporal organization of the cellular environment,,

Numerical efficiencies have been reported in the cases of aggressive coarse-graining, where several lipids are coarse-grained into a particle of size 4∼6 nm so that there is only one particle in the thickness direction. Yuan et al. proposed a pair-potential between these one-particle-thick coarse-grained lipid particles to capture the mechanical properties of a lipid bilayer membrane, such as gel-fluid-gas phase transitions of lipids, diffusion, and bending rigidity Yuan et al. (2010). In this work we implement such an interaction potential in LAMMPS to simulate large-scale lipid systems such as a giant unilamminar vesicle (GUV) and red blood cells (RBCs). We also consider the effect of cytoskeleton on the lipid membrane dynamics as a model for RBC dynamics, and incorporate coarse-grained water molecules to account for hydrodynamic interactions. The interaction between the coarse-grained water molecules (explicit solvent molecules) is modeled as a Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. To demonstrate that the proposed methods do capture the observed dynamics of vesicles and RBCs, we focus on two sets of LAMMPS simulations: 1. Vesicle shape transitions with enclosed volume; 2. RBC shape transitions with different enclosed volume.

Phillips. ❧ Third, using extensive MD simulations, we compute the various correlation functions for water in SiCNTs and CNTs over the temperature range 100 K - 298 K, demonstrating that, in agreement with our calculation of the cage‐cage correlation function, due to spatial limitations and steric hindrance inside small enough nanotubes, water inside such nanotubes does not freeze. This has significant scientific and biological implications, potentially providing a method for preserving microorganisms for very long time for advanced research and studies. ❧ Finally, we develop an atomistic model of mixed‐matric polymeric composite made of polyetherimide (PEI) and SiCNTs and study, (i) the mechanical properties of the composite and compare them with those of pure PEI, and (ii) diffusion and sorption of several light gases in the composite in order to test its potential use as a membrane for gas separation.

It is the epicenter of cellular function, and, given its complicated composition, even minute alterations in its structure can prompt extensive consequences. Understanding the dynamics of the plasma membrane can, therefore, provide a powerful glimpse into how life works and how it can be influenced. This dissertation details the development and application of new tools created to further our understanding of the structure and function of the plasma membrane. These tools are based on pulsed power, nonlinear optics, scientific computing, and data visualization. ❧ The primary means for asking questions of this membrane will be brief (~ns) but intense (MV/m) electric pulses termed nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs). Pulsed power, like nsPEFs, is a valuable biomedical tool that is capable of controllably disrupting the membrane, making it an ideal means of testing new methodologies and techniques. Using multimodal probes and the specialized selection criteria of second harmonic generation (SHG), the development, both theoretical and practical, of a new methodology for measuring localized membrane disruption is presented. Once established, this new methodology is applied to investigate the effect of novel stimuli on the cell membrane. One such stimulus is bipolar nsPEFs, which are used to understand the role of membrane charging on nanopore development. Another stimulus of interest is infrared (IR) pulses, which we apply to primary neurons in order to conduct a mechanistic comparison of optical and electrical neural stimulation. ❧ Finally, the closing chapters of this dissertation outline efforts to develop an immersive data visualization framework capable of applying scientific computing to components of the membrane. While this framework is not limited to studies of the membrane, for the purposes of this dissertation, it provides a well-defined roadmap for further experimentation. For example, the software framework allows for dynamic simulation and visualization of nonequilibrium phase transitions in biological electron transport pathways, pivotal for cellular respiration.

We have combined molecular dynamics simulations of the ErbB kinases with the protein structure network modeling to characterize the reorganization of the residue interaction networks during conformational equilibrium changes in the normal and oncogenic forms. Structural stability and network analyses have identified local communities integrated around high centrality sites that correspond to the regulatory spine residues. This analysis has provided a quantitative insight to the mechanism of mutation-induced “superacceptor” activity in oncogenic EGFR dimers. We have found that kinase activation may be determined by allosteric interactions between modules of structurally stable residues that synchronize the dynamics in the nucleotide binding site and the αC-helix with the collective motions of the integrating αF-helix and the substrate binding site. The results of this study have pointed to a central role of the conserved His-Arg-Asp (HRD) motif in the catalytic loop and the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif as key mediators of structural stability and allosteric communications in the ErbB kinases. We have determined that residues that are indispensable for kinase regulation and catalysis often corresponded to the high centrality nodes within the protein structure network and could be distinguished by their unique network signatures. The optimal communication pathways are also controlled by these nodes and may ensure efficient allosteric signaling in the functional kinase state. Structure-based network analysis has quantified subtle effects of ATP binding on conformational dynamics and stability of the EGFR structures. Consistent with the NMR studies, we have found that nucleotide-induced modulation of the residue interaction networks is not limited to the ATP site, and may enhance allosteric cooperativity with the substrate binding region by increasing communication capabilities of mediating residues.",10.5061/dryad.qj597,protein kinases|protein structure network analysis|structural stability|force constant analysis,School of Computational Sciences|Department of Pharmacology|University of California San Diego|Schmid College of Science and Technology|Chapman University,,,2014-12-03,DRYAD,Data from: Structure-based network analysis of activation mechanisms in the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases:  the regulatory spine residues are global mediators of structural stability and allosteric interactions,,

Several computational studies have been performed to investigate conformational and dynamical properties of TCRs for enhanced immunogenicity. Here, we present the large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the two comprehensive systems consisting of the wild-type and mutant IG4 TCR in complex with the tumor epitope NY-ESO peptide (SLLMWITQC) and analyzed for mapping conformational changes of TCR in the states prior to antigen binding, upon antigen binding and after the antigen was released. All of the simulations were performed with different states of TCRs for each 1000 ns of simulation time, providing six simulations for time duration of 6000 ns (6µs). We show that rather than undergoing most critical conformational changes upon antigen binding, the high proportion of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops change by comparatively small amount. The hypervariable CDRα3 and CDRβ3 loops showed significant structural changes. Interestingly, the TCR β chain loops showed the least changes, which is reliable with recent implications that β domain of TCR may propel antigen interaction. The mutant shows higher rigidity than wild-type even in released state; expose an induced fit mechanism occurring from the re-structuring of CDRα3 loop and can allow enhanced binding affinity of the peptide antigen.

Critical to the applications of proteins in non-aqueous enzymatic processes is their structural dynamics in relation to solvent polarity. A pool of mutants derived from Geobacillus zalihae T1 lipase was developed using random mutagenesis (error-prone PCR). High-throughput screening of the variants in organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol) at a temperature of 60 oC resulted in the selection of six (6) mutants (A83D/K251E, R21C, G35D/S195N, K84R/R103C/M121I/T272M, and R106H/G327S). Site-directed mutagenesis further yielded quadruple mutants A83D/M121I/K251E/G327S and A83D/M121I/S195N/T272M, both of which had improved stability in methanol, ethanol, and propanol. Kinetic investigation showed that the km and kcat values of these mutants were not significantly different from those of the wild-type enzyme, in contrast to those in the methanol/substrate mixture. Greater half-life was achieved for all mutant proteins in methanol with better exponential decay constants. The biophysical properties in 50 % and 60 % methanol showed that on the whole, thermally induced unfolding of mutants was accompanied with some loss of secondary structure content. Molecular Dynamic simulations were relied upon to provide insight into perturbations of the protein matrix which triggered a reorganization of the secondary structural elements. This revealed that changes in the structural organization are intertwined with the conformational interplay of the protein backbone with the organic solvents. The solvent simulations were found to induce conformational changes on the protein surface resulting in induced changes between structural features and the conformational stability of the protein. Correlations were seen between solvent mobility and residue motions as indicated by the state of the root mean square deviations (RMSD) and B-factor. Spatially-exposed charged residues of the mutants showed correlations between the solvation dynamics of the methanol solvent and the hydrophobicity of the residues. The short distances of the radial distribution function provided the required distances for hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions. The newly formed structural interactions between the mutant residues and the other surrounding residues enhanced the native conformation of the secondary structural characteristics of the quadruple mutants A83D/M121I/S195N/T272M and A83D/M121I/K251E/G375S. The dynamic changes revealed by MD insights demonstrates the engineered mutants although manifest an appreciable amount of stability to methanol, if further improved upon are promising candidates for future application as biocatalysts for non-aqueous processes.

Limited anti-venom therapy (with their lower efficacy) has attracted considerable pharmacological interest to develop potent inhibitors of PLA2. Thus, 34 experimentally proven and diverse synthetic inhibitors of PLA2 were screened primarily on the basis of Glide extra precision docking and MM-GBSA rescoring function. Then, ten potential hits were subjected to induced fit docking, in which top three potential inhibitors were considered, and those were found to interact with Ca2+, disulfide binding site, and phosphatidylcholine activation sites, thereby, possibly disrupting the catalytic activity of Ca2+ as well as the inflammatory functions of PLA2. These compounds showed positive remarks on various physiochemical properties and pharmacologically relevant descriptors. Gap energy and thermodynamic properties were investigated by employing density functional theory for all compounds to understand their chemical reactivity and thermodynamic stability. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed for 100 ns in order to evaluate the stability and binding modes of docked complexes, and the energy of binding was calculated through MM-PBSA analysis. On the whole, the proposed compounds could be used for targeted inhibition. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Meiosis-specific protein HOP2 plays essential roles in recombination by promoting recombinase activities. The N-terminal domain of HOP2 interacts with DNA through helix 3 (H3) and wing 1 (W1). Mutations in wing 1 (Y65A/K67A/Q68A) slightly weakened the binding but mutations in helices 2 and 3 (Q30A/K44A/K49A) nearly abolished the binding. To better understand such differential effects at atomic level, molecular dynamics simulations were employed. Despite losing some hydrogen bonds, the W1-mutant DNA complex was rescued by stronger hydrophobic interactions. For the wild type and W1-mutant, the protein was found to slide along the DNA grooves as the DNA rolls along its double-helix axis. This motion could be functionally important to facilitate the precise positioning of the single-stranded DNA with the homologous double-stranded DNA. The sliding motion was reduced in the W1-mutant. The H-mutant nearly lost all intermolecular interactions. Moreover, an additional mutation in wing 1 (Y65A/K67A/Q68A/K69A) also caused complete complex dissociation. Therefore, both wing 1 and helix 3 make important contribution to the DNA binding, which could be important to the strand invasion function of HOP2 homodimer and HOP2-MND1 heterodimer. Similar to cocking a medieval crossbow with the archer’s foot placed in the stirrup, wing 1 may push the minor groove to cause distortion while helix 3 grabs the major groove.",10.6084/m9.figshare.5091688.v1,Medicine|Microbiology|Molecular Biology|29999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified|Genetics|Biochemistry|Biophysics|Developmental Biology|Cancer,,,,2017-01-01,figshare.ars,Wing 1 of protein HOP2 is as important as helix 3 in DNA binding by MD simulation,,

Here we investigated the migratory orientation of juvenile lesser spotted eagles (LSE) (Clanga pomarina) based on translocation and satellite tracking. Between 2004 and 2016, 85 second-hatched juveniles (Abels) were reared in captivity for release into the declining German population, including 50 birds that were translocated 940 km from Latvia. In 2009, we tracked 12 translocated juveniles, as well as 8 native juveniles and 9 native adults, to determine how inexperienced birds come to use strategic migration routes. Native juveniles departed around the same time as the adults and 6 of 8 used the eastern flyway around the Mediterranean, which was used by all adults. In contrast, translocated juveniles departed on average 6 days before native LSEs, and 5 traveled southward and died in the central Mediterranean region. Consequently fewer translocated juveniles (4/12) than native juveniles (7/8) reached Africa. We conclude that juvenile LSEs have a much better chance of learning the strategic southeastern flyway if they leave at an appropriate time to connect with experienced elders upon departure. It is not clear why translocated juveniles departed so early. Regardless, by the end of the year, most juveniles had perished, whether they were translocated (10/12) or not (6/8). The small number of surviving translocated juveniles thus still represents a significant increase in the annual productivity of the German LSE population in 2009.",10.5061/dryad.82j26,conservation|orientation|translocation|eagle|satellite-tracking|Orientation|bird migration,Theoretical and Computational Ecology|Inst. for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics|Latvijas valsts meži|BirdLife Germany (NABU)|Brandenburg State Bird Conservation Centre|World Working Group on Birds of Prey|Free University Berlin|University of Amsterdam|Department of Biology|Vansteelant Eco Research|Veterinarian practice|Agency of Forestry,Aquila pomarina,,2017-05-10,DRYAD,Data from: Orientation of native versus translocated juvenile Lesser Spotted Eagles (Clanga pomarina) on the first autumn migration,,

Orb2 has two isoforms, Orb2A and Orb2B, and their interaction to form functional amyloids is hypothesized to be a key step in the memory formation process. Huntingtin is a protein that can form pathological amyloids and cause Huntington’s disease when mutated. It also has critical functional roles in normal neural development when not mutated. ❧ In this thesis, I present a series of experiments on Orb2, with goal of understanding the amyloid structure and how it relates to Orb2’s biological role. I show that Orb2 is capable of forming protein droplets and two different types of fibrils (one of which seems to be derived from droplets). I also show that fibrils formed by Orb2A and Orb2B are highly similar and that within a single monomer in a fibril, residues range in dynamics from extremely static to almost liquid-like. I also present a series of molecular dynamics simulations of a domain of Huntingtin. I show that these simulations can reproduce EPR and NMR data gathered on Huntingtin fibrils, and also help to identify what appears to be a highly conserved protein-protein interaction site in the domain. ❧ Because this thesis covers a range of experiments on different proteins from different sources, I first present an introduction providing a general background for all topics and methods discussed (CHAPTER 1.

Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions, capable of transferring infectious items among individuals, to build transmission networks of diffusion. However, delayed indirect interactions, where a susceptible individual interacts with infectious items after the infected individual has left the interaction space, can also cause transmission events. We define a diffusion model called the same place different time transmission (SPDT) based diffusion that considers transmission links for these indirect interactions. Our SPDT model changes the network dynamics where the connectivity among individuals varies with the decay rates of link infectivity. We investigate SPDT diffusion behaviours by simulating airborne disease spreading on data-driven contact networks. The SPDT model significantly increases diffusion dynamics with a high rate of disease transmission. By making the underlying connectivity denser and stronger due to the inclusion of indirect transmissions, SPDT models are more realistic than SPST models for the study of various airborne diseases outbreaks. Importantly, we also find that the diffusion dynamics including indirect links are not reproducible by the current SPST models based on direct links, even if both SPDT and SPST networks assume the same underlying connectivity. This is because the transmission dynamics of indirect links are different from those of direct links. These outcomes highlight the importance of the indirect links for predicting outbreaks of airborne diseases.",10.5061/dryad.g893nb0,influenza|epidemiology|Contact network|mathematical model|diffusion process,,,,2019-07-22,DRYAD,Data from: Indirect interactions influence contact network structure and diffusion dynamics,,

Critical to the applications of proteins in non-aqueous enzymatic processes is their structural dynamics in relation to solvent polarity. A pool of mutants derived from Geobacillus zalihae T1 lipase was developed using random mutagenesis (error-prone PCR). High-throughput screening of the variants in organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol) at a temperature of 60 oC resulted in the selection of six (6) mutants (A83D/K251E, R21C, G35D/S195N, K84R/R103C/M121I/T272M, and R106H/G327S). Site-directed mutagenesis further yielded quadruple mutants A83D/M121I/K251E/G327S and A83D/M121I/S195N/T272M, both of which had improved stability in methanol, ethanol, and propanol. Kinetic investigation showed that the km and kcat values of these mutants were not significantly different from those of the wild-type enzyme, in contrast to those in the methanol/substrate mixture. Greater half-life was achieved for all mutant proteins in methanol with better exponential decay constants. The biophysical properties in 50 % and 60 % methanol showed that on the whole, thermally induced unfolding of mutants was accompanied with some loss of secondary structure content. Molecular Dynamic simulations were relied upon to provide insight into perturbations of the protein matrix which triggered a reorganization of the secondary structural elements. This revealed that changes in the structural organization are intertwined with the conformational interplay of the protein backbone with the organic solvents. The solvent simulations were found to induce conformational changes on the protein surface resulting in induced changes between structural features and the conformational stability of the protein. Correlations were seen between solvent mobility and residue motions as indicated by the state of the root mean square deviations (RMSD) and B-factor. Spatially-exposed charged residues of the mutants showed correlations between the solvation dynamics of the methanol solvent and the hydrophobicity of the residues. The short distances of the radial distribution function provided the required distances for hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions. The newly formed structural interactions between the mutant residues and the other surrounding residues enhanced the native conformation of the secondary structural characteristics of the quadruple mutants A83D/M121I/S195N/T272M and A83D/M121I/K251E/G375S. The dynamic changes revealed by MD insights demonstrates the engineered mutants although manifest an appreciable amount of stability to methanol, if further improved upon are promising candidates for future application as biocatalysts for non-aqueous processes.

Some PCs inverted their direction in the presence of a ligand, and comparison of the PCs between 3EML and 3EML_ADN showed that adenosine induced major changes in the structure of A2AR. Rearrangement of PCs precedes and drives conformational changes that occur after ligand binding. Knowledge about these conformational changes provides important insights about the activity of A2AR.",10.6084/m9.figshare.7610525,Biotechnology|Immunology|Molecular Biology|Computational Biology|Genetics|39999 Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified|Biochemistry|Biophysics,,,,2019-01-01,figshare.ars,Studying the collective motions of the adenosine A2A receptor as a result of ligand binding using principal component analysis,,

They are widely applied in food products to enhance the health function as well as used in developing nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products. A limiting factor hampering the use of flavonoids in many applications is its low water solubility and stability. In the present study, the inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin and dimethyl derivative to solve this problem is our aim. Molecular behaviours of inclusion complex between hesperetin or naringenin and β-CD/DM-β-CD, were theoretically investigated using the molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Both hesperetin and naringenin most likely preferred to bind with CDs cavity via the phenyl ring with a formation of strong hydrogen bonds. The system stability and solubility of the two flavanones in complex with DM-β-CD was considerably more stable and soluble than that with β-CD. To support these results, we examined the phase solubility diagram of the two flavanones inclusion complexes. The result showed the formation of soluble complex as AL type, indicating increase in flavanone stability when cyclodextrin was increased, with higher solubility of the DM-β-CD complexes. Solid complexes were prepared and DSC and FTIR were used to confirm the inclusion complex. From the DSC profile, the endothermic peak of free hesperetin and naringenin in the 1:1 inclusion complex formed by freeze-drying method disappeared, with the appearance of a new endothermic peak. This implied that the real inclusion complex was formed while the kneading method did not result in the formation of inclusion complex. Moreover, we examined the release of flavanones from the inclusion complexes compared to the free flavanones by dissolution method. It is clearly seen that the complexation with DM-β-CD made better release of both flavanones to the aqueous solution than with β-CD complexes.",10.14457/cu.the.2013.1385,Citrus fruits|ผลไม้ตระกูลส้ม|Flavonoids|ฟลาโวนอยส์|การอบแห้ง|Drying,,,,2013-01-01,nrct.db1,ENHANCEMENT OF WATER SOLUBILITY OF HESPERETIN AND NARINGENIN BY COMPLEXATION WITH β-CYCLODEXTRIN AND ITS DIMETHYL DERIVATIVE,,

The detrimental effect of non-synonymous mutations of HMGB1 has not been investigated yet, hence the present study aims to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms and their implications on the structure-function of human HMGB1. The multifaceted HMGB1 protein acts as pleiotropic cytokine and regulates essential genes for coordinated cellular functions. The mutational effect on HMGB1 was analyzed by sequence-based homology methods, supervised learning methods, and structure-based methods. The study identified 58 non-synonymous mutations in human HMGB1, out of which only 2 mutations; R10T (rs61742222) and F103C (rs61733675) were classified as the SNPs with highest deleterious and disease-causing mutants. The effect of these mutations in structure of HMGB1 was scrutinized and the R10T mutant found to have a distinct structural behaviour in the B-box domain. In addition, R10T mutant predicted that it affects the MoRF function of HMGB1 and it could disrupt the DNA binding or/and protein partner interaction activity by HMGB1. F103C mutation takes place at the TLR binding and cytokine inducing region of HMGB1, hence it could affect the protein binding activity which involves in many cellular signaling. The study identified potent mutations R10T (a cancer-causing somatic mutation) and F103C (a novel mutation) and these mutations either directly or indirectly hinder DNA binding activity and TLR and cytokine binding of HMGB1. These findings will help in understanding the molecular basis of these promising mutations and functional role of human HMGB1 in cancer and immunological diseases.

However, the computational cost of electronic structure methods drastically increases with length and time scales, which makes these methods difficult for long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations or large-sized systems. Machine-learning techniques can provide accurate potentials that can match the quality of electronic structure calculations, provided sufficient training data. These potentials can then be used to rapidly simulate large and long time-scale phenomena at similar quality to the parent electronic structure approach. Machine-learning potentials usually take a bias-free mathematical form and can be readily developed for a wide variety of systems. Electronic structure calculations have favorable properties–namely that they are noiseless and targeted training data can be produced on-demand–that make them particularly well-suited for machine learning. This paper discusses our modular approach to atomistic machine learning through the development of the open-source Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp), which allows for representations of both the total and atom-centered potential energy surface, in both periodic and non-periodic systems. Potentials developed through the atom-centered approach are simultaneously applicable for systems with various sizes. Interpolation can be enhanced by introducing custom descriptors of the local environment. We demonstrate this in the current work for Gaussian-type, bispectrum, and Zernike-type descriptors. Amp  has an intuitive and modular structure with an interface through the python scripting language yet has parallelizable fortran components for demanding tasks; it is designed to integrate closely with the widely used Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), which makes it compatible with a wide variety of commercial and open-source electronic structure codes. We finally demonstrate that the neural network model inside Amp  can accurately interpolate electronic structure energies as well as forces of thousands of multi-species atomic systems.",10.17632/b3jnxf8m7c.1,Natural Sciences,,Natural Sciences,,2016-08-19,MENDELEY_DATA,Amp: A modular approach to machine learning in atomistic simulations,article,1

Additionally, it has been found as hub gene in PPI network, suggesting its possible regulatory role in breast carcinogenesis. Moreover, PAK1 had role in progression of various diseases as neoplasia, tumorigenesis, lymphatic neoplasia. Thereby, PAK1 can be used as a therapeutic target in breast cancer. Further, we put our efforts in identification of potential small molecules inhibitors against PAK1 by developing a composite virtual screening protocol involving molecular dynamics (MD) and molecular docking. The chemical library of compounds from NCI diversity sets, Pubchem and eMolecules were screened against PAK1 protein and hits which showed good binding affinity were considered for MD simulation study. Moreover, to assess binding of selected hits, MMGBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) analysis was performed using AMBER (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) package. MMGBSA calculations exhibited that the identified ligands showed good binding affinity with PAK1.

We employed non-invasive sampling and amplification of microsatellite loci to investigate population size and density, spatial organization, and relatedness of a wild Neotropical otter population in an Atlantic forest area in southern Brazil.

Spatial organization analysis indicated that male cumulative displacement was higher than that of females, with the latter sex showing evidence of philopatric behaviour. Also, the reconstruction of genealogical relationships suggests that spatial organization in this otter appears to be influenced by relatedness.

We here present a revised version, v1.1, of the KMCLib general framework for kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulations. The generation of random numbers in KMCLib now relies on the C++11 standard library implementation, and support has been added for the user to choose from a set of C++11 implemented random number generators. The Mersenne-twister, the 24 and 48 bit RANLUX and a ‘minimal-standard’ PRNG are supported. We have also included the possibility to use true random numbers via the C++11 st...

Nature of problem 
Atomic scale simulation of slowly evolving dynamics is a great challenge in many areas of computational materials science and catalysis. When the rare-events dynamics of interest is orders of magnitude slower than the typical atomic vibrational frequencies a straight-forward propagation of the equations of motions for the particles in the simulation can not reach time scales of relevance for modeling the slow dynamics.

It can solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schrödinger and Liouville–von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows, e.g., to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semi-classical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. Being highly versatile and offering visualization of quantum dynamics ‘on the fly’, WavePacket is well suited for teaching or research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics as well as in physical or theoretical chemistry. Building on the previous Part I [Comp. Phys. Comm. 213, 223–234 (2017)] which dealt with closed quantum systems and discrete variable representations, the present Part II focuses on the dynamics of open quantum systems, with Lindblad operators modeling dissipation and dephasing. This part also describes the WavePacket function for optimal control of quantum dynamics, building on rapid monotonically convergent iteration methods. Furthermore, two different approaches to dimension reduction implemented in WavePacket are documented here. In the first one, a balancing transformation based on the concepts of controllability and observability Gramians is used to identify states that are neither well controllable nor well observable. Those states are either truncated or averaged out. In the other approach, the H2-error for a given reduced dimensionality is minimized by H2 optimal model reduction techniques, utilizing a bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm.

The present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.3.0 which is hosted and further developed at the Sourceforge platform, where also extensive Wiki-documentation as well as numerous worked-out demonstration examples with animated graphics can be found.",10.17632/9g8b7jychy.1,Computational Physics,,Computational Physics,,2018-03-27,MENDELEY_DATA,"WavePacket: A Matlab package for numerical quantum dynamics.

These histograms represent 2-point spatial correlation functions and are routinely calculated from simulations of soft and condensed matter, where they are referred to as radial distribution functions, and in the analysis of the spatial distributions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Although conceptually simple, the calculation of radial distribution functions via distance binning requires the evaluation of O(N^2) particle-pair distances where N is the number of particles under consideration. CADISHI provides fast parallel implementations of the distance histogram algorithm for the CPU and the GPU, written in templated C++ and CUDA. Orthorhombic and general triclinic periodic boxes are supported, in addition to the non-periodic case. The CPU kernels feature cache-blocking, vectorization and thread-parallelization to obtain high performance. The GPU kernels are tuned to exploit the memory and processor features of current GPUs, demonstrating histogramming rates of up to a factor 40 higher than on a high-end multi-core CPU. To enable high-throughput analyses of molecular dynamics trajectories, the compute kernels are driven by the Python-based CADISHI engine. It implements a producer–consumer data processing pattern and thereby enables the complete utilization of all the CPU and GPU resources available on a specific computer, independent of special libraries such as MPI, covering commodity systems up to high-end HPC nodes. Data input and output are performed efficiently via HDF5. In addition, our CPU and GPU kernels can be compiled into a standard C library and used with any application, independent from the CADISHI engine or Python.

In common with other membrane protein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers and protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules. We study here a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold reaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to capture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and characteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that our stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field models of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of analytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction dynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we find substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the reaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion properties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous experiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed single-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates at which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Finally, inspired by our results on synaptic domains, we investigate the diffusion of particles through media with spatially inhomogeneous particle hopping rates, both in the presence and absence of steric constraints on the particle density. Based on the deterministic parts of the corresponding lattice Langevin equations we obtain general solutions for the fractions of all particles in regions with distinct particle hopping rates, for arbitrary spatial dimensions of the system and numbers of distinct particle species. We confirm our general solutions using KMC simulations.

Understanding the energy coupling of NTP hydrolysis cycle to the DNA movement is the key to understand the DNA replication mechanism in the molecular motor. The helicase domain of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40 LTag) is a ring-shaped AAA+ domain that participates in viral DNA replication and host cell growth control. Recent SV40 LTag structure studies have provided a set of high resolution structures in different nucleotide binding states. Hence, in this thesis we use LTag helicase as a model protein, and present the first systematic simulation study on the mechanism of the LTag helicase motor. Our work includes three major sections: first, we model the LTag ATPase activity and the helicase activity based on the biochemistry experiment results. This model indicates that the LTag helicase subunits work in highly cooperative patterns. When the origin DNA is presented, the helicase translocates DNA in a sequential pattern. When the fork DNA is added, the helicase works in a semi-sequential pattern, otherwise, the subunit cooperativity is not significant. Second, we present the first simulation study on the ATP binding/hydrolsis procedure using the non-equilibrated molecular dynamics method, the results suggest a three-stage Locker-binding model. We evaluate the energy profile using the LRA version of the semi-microscopic Protein Dipoles-Langvin Dipoles method (PDLD/S). The energy profile matches the experimental results. Thirdly, we investigate the electrostatic energy that guides the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) translocation process and propose a unidirectional translocation model. To accomplish this work, an ssDNA/LTag complex model is built using the structure information from the LTag helicase and the E1 protein-DNA complex, a two-dimensional effective electrostatic free-energy landscape is calculated based on the ssDNA/LTag model, and the unidirectional model is proposed by evaluating the energy landscape. The time dependence of the coupled protein-DNA motion is explored by simulating the translocation process using a renormalized method. Altogether, our theoretical and simulation study advanced our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanism underlying the directional movement of ring-shaped helicase motor.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-20225,computational simulation|hHelicase motor|binomial model|Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|simian virus 40|DNA translocation|large tumor antigen|molecular dynamics|ATP binding|DNA unwinding,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Simulating the helicase motor of SV40 large tumor antigen,,

Each of these proteins was embedded in a Lo membrane consisting of DSPC, cholesterol, and varying levels (0–16 mol%) of SDPE. First, the lipids were allowed to reorganize during a 10 microsecond simulations. Then, for each protein and for each SDPE concentration, the DSPC lipids were mutated into DOPC ones and the free energy of this change was calculated. This process was repeated in the absence of the proteins for each SDPE concentration. By substracting the corresponding values for the protein-containing and protein-free cases, the free energy of transfer between Lo and Ld domains was calculated for each of the proteins as a function of SDPE concentration. All simulations were performed using the Martini force field [1] and the GROMACS simulation package [2]. For more details of the setup and the simulations, please see the related paper at DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007033.

The original equilibration simulations (10 microseconds in the presence of the protein and SDPE and shorter in the absence of either SDPE or the protein). The run input files for these simulations are provided as X_PUFAY_EQ.tpr and the trajectories as X_PUFAY_EQ.xtc, where X stands for the protein (or says 'NOPROT' for the case without protein) and Y for the SDPE concentration.

The run input files for the free energy of transfer simulations are provided as the tar files; one tar for each protein and one for the protein-free case. Each of these tars contains a folder for each used SDPE concentration, including the more realistic membrane compositions (with a suffix 'REAL'). For each SDPE concentration, the run input files (tpr) and the simulation input parameter files (mdp) for each window in the free energy perturbation are provided. Here, the windows are numbered from 0 to 26, where 0 corresponds to DSPC and 26 to DOPC. Also, for each SDPE concentration, common topology (top), index (ndx) and start configuration (gro) are provided. The molecule definitions (itp) are provided in the TOP.tar archive.

The algorithm assumes the use of some localized functions as a basis set to represent the spatial degrees of freedom. It relies on an iterative computation of the induced density according to the Dyson-like equation for the linear response function. The current implementation is built upon so-called numerical atomic orbitals. It is suitable for a wide variety of density functional theory (DFT) software. In this work, we demonstrate TDDFT calculations starting from preceding DFT runs with SIESTA, GPAW and PySCF packages, while a coupling with the other DFT packages such as Fireball and OpenMX is planned. The mentioned packages are capable of performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and the speed of our TDDFT implementation makes feasible to perform a configuration average of the optical absorption spectra. Our code is written mostly in Python language allowing for a quick and compact implementation of most numerical methods and data-managing tasks with the help of NumPy/SciPy libraries and Python intrinsic constructs. Part of the code is written in C and Fortran to achieve a competitive speed in particular sections of the algorithm. Many parts of the current algorithm and implementation are useful in other ab initio methods for electronic excited states, such as Hedin’s GW, Bethe–Salpeter equation and DFT with hybrid functionals.

In general, viral protein 40 is the key protein for the oligomerization, the N-terminal loop region in the viral protein 40 and it is essential for the viral replication in Ebola. The electronic structures of native N-terminal loop (His124-Asn134) and metalized (Mn+=Ag+ and Cu2+) complexes are optimized at the M06-2X/LANL2DZ level of theory. Among Mn+-interacted N-loop complexes, Cu2+-interacted N-terminal loop complex has the highest interaction energy of –973.519 kcal/mol and also it has the stabilization energy in the range of 9.92 kcal/mol. The cation-π interactions between His124, Pro131 and Arg134 residues are the important factor, which enhances the interaction energy of viral protein 40. Due to the chelation behavior of metal ions, the backbone and the side chains of N-terminal loop regions are deviated from the planarity that results in the formation of classical hydrogen bonds between N-terminal loop regions. Molecular dynamics simulation studies also revealed that the structural transformations of Nloop into a stable α-helix and β-sheet folded conformations due to the interaction of Ag+ and Cu2+ ions in the N-terminal loop region. The hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the stability and structural changes in N-terminal loop region. Therefore, it is clear that interaction of metal ion with viral protein-40 reduces the replication of the disease by inducing the secondary structural changes. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The system is built as a pyramid of increasing complexity, with two E1 (ubiquitin activating), few dozen E2 (ubiquitin conjugating) and several hundred E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. By collecting and analyzing E3 sequences from the KEGG BRITE database and literature, we assembled a coherent dataset of 563 human E3s and analyzed their various physical features. We found an increase in structural disorder of the system with multiple disorder predictors (IUPred – E1: 5.97%, E2: 17.74%, E3: 20.03%). E3s that can bind E2 and substrate simultaneously (single subunit E3, ssE3) have significantly higher disorder (22.98%) than E3s in which E2 binding (multi RING-finger, mRF, 0.62%), scaffolding (6.01%) and substrate binding (adaptor/substrate recognition subunits, 17.33%) functions are separated. In ssE3s, the disorder was localized in the substrate/adaptor binding domains, whereas the E2-binding RING/HECT-domains were structured. To demonstrate the involvement of disorder in E3 function, we applied normal modes and molecular dynamics analyses to show how a disordered and highly flexible linker in human CBL (an E3 that acts as a regulator of several tyrosine kinase-mediated signalling pathways) facilitates long-range conformational changes bringing substrate and E2-binding domains towards each other and thus assisting in ubiquitin transfer. E3s with multiple interaction partners (as evidenced by data in STRING) also possess elevated levels of disorder (hubs, 22.90% vs. non-hubs, 18.36%). Furthermore, a search in PDB uncovered 21 distinct human E3 interactions, in 7 of which the disordered region of E3s undergoes induced folding (or mutual induced folding) in the presence of the partner. In conclusion, our data highlights the primary role of structural disorder in the functions of E3 ligases that manifests itself in the substrate/adaptor binding functions as well as the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by long-range conformational transitions.",10.5061/dryad.84kj5,,VIB Department of Structural Biology|Institute of Enzymology|Vrije Universiteit Brussel|Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Research Centre for Natural Sciences,,,2016-04-26,DRYAD,Data from: Functional diversity and structural disorder in the human ubiquitination pathway,,

Monitoring the collapse of a cavitation nanobubble, we observe a focused nanojet at the onset of bubble shrinkage and a water hammer shock wave upon bubble collapse. The nanojet length scales linearly with the nanobubble radius, as observed in experiments on micron-to-millimeter size bubbles. The shock induces dramatic structural changes, including an ice-VII-like structural motif at a particle velocity of approximately 1 km/s. The incipient ice VII formation and the calculated Hugoniot curve are in good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, a substantial number of positive and negative ions appear when the nanojet hits the distal side of the nanobubble and the water hammer shock forms. Furthermore, two promising applications of shock-induced nanobubble collapse have been explored. Our simulations of poration in lipid bilayers due to shock-induced collapse of nanobubbles reveal penetration of nanojets into lipid bilayers. The nanojet impact generates shear flow of water on bilayer leaflets and pressure gradients across them, which transiently enhance the bilayer permeability by creating nanopores through which water molecules translocate across the bilayer. The effects of nanobubble size and temperature on the porosity of lipid bilayers are examined. Finally, the shock-induced collapse of CO2-filled nanobubbles in water is investigated. The energetic nanojet and high-pressure water hammer shock formed during and after collapse of the nanobubble trigger mechano-chemical H2O-CO2 reactions, some of which lead to splitting of water molecules.

Current therapeutic strategies of Diabetic Nephropathy are based on control of modifiable risks like hypertension, glucose levels, and dyslipidemia. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) is implicated in several metabolic syndromes including Diabetic Nephropathy, besides obesity, insulin insensitivity, dislipidemia, inflammation, and hypertension. In the present study, virtual screening of 617 compounds from two different public databases was done against PPAR-γ with an objective to find a possible lead compound. Two softwares, PyRx and iGEMDOCK, were used to achieve the docking accuracy in order to avoid loss of candidate compounds. Rosiglitazone (used to treat Diabetic Nephropathy) was taken as the standard compound. A total of 30 compounds with good binding affinity with PPAR-γ were selected for further filtering, on the basis of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). The interaction profiling of these 30 compounds, showed a minimum of one and maximum of three interactions with reference to rosiglitazone (SER-289, HIS-449, HIS-323, TYR-473). The fulfilling of ADMET analysis criteria of 30 compounds led to the selection of four compounds (ZINC ID 00181552, 00276456, 00298314, 00448009). Molecular dynamics simulation of these lead compounds in complex with PPAR-γ revealed that three of the four compounds formed a stable complex in the ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-γ during 20-ns simulation. Hence, these three (ZINC ID 00181552, 00276456, 00298314) of the four compounds are potential candidates for experimental validation of biological activity against PPAR-γ in future drug discovery studies.",10.6084/m9.figshare.5091859.v1,Medicine|Genetics|39999 Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified|69999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified|Biochemistry|Pharmacology|80699 Information Systems not elsewhere classified,,,,2017-01-01,figshare.ars,In silico identification of potential drug compound against Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma by virtual screening and toxicity studies for the treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy,,

However, it is a great challenge to design an efficient parallelization framework that continues to scale on future architectures due to the complexity of real-world applications and the variety of multi-core/many-core platforms. ❧ To address this challenge, I propose a hierarchical optimization framework that maps applications to hardware by exploiting multiple levels of parallelization: (1) Inter-node level parallelism via spatial decomposition; (2) inter-core level parallelism via cellular decomposition; and (3) single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization. The framework includes application-based SIMD analysis and optimization, which allows application scientists to determine whether their applications are viable for SIMDization and provide various code transformation techniques to enhance the SIMD efficiency as well as simple recipes when compiler auto-vectorization fails. I also propose a suite of optimization strategies to achieve ideal on-chip inter-core strong scalability on emerging many-core architectures: (1) A divide-and-conquer algorithm adaptive to local memory; (2) a novel data layout to improve data locality; (3) on-chip locality-aware parallel algorithms to enhance data reuse; and (4) a pipeline algorithm using data transfer agent to orchestrate computation and memory operations to hide latency to shared memory. ❧ I have applied the framework to three scientific applications, which represent most of the numerical classes in the seven dwarfs (which are known to cover most high performance computing applications): (1) Stencil computation, specifically lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)for fluid flow simulation; (2) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation; and (3) molecular fragment analysis via connected component detection. ❧ I have achieved high inter-node, inter-core (multithreading), and SIMD efficiency on various computing platforms: (1) For LBM, inter-node parallel efficiency 0.978 on 131,072 BlueGene/P processors, multithreading efficiency 0.882 on 6 cores of a Cell BE, and SIMD efficiency 0.780 using 4-element vector registers of a Cell BE; (2) for MD simulation, inter-node parallel efficiency 0.985 on 106,496 BlueGene/L processors, and inter-core multithreading parallel efficiency 0.99 on the 64-core Godson-T many-core architecture; (3) for molecular fragment analysis, nearly linear inter-node strong scalability up to 50 million vertices molecular graph on 32 computing nodes, and over 13-fold inter-core speedup on 16 cores. In addition, a simple performance model based on hierarchical parallelization is derived, which suggests that the optimization scheme is likely to scale well toward exascale. Furthermore, I have analyzed the impact of architectural features on applications' performance to find that certain architectural features are essential for these optimizations. ❧ This research not only suggests viable optimization techniques for broad scientific applications on future many-core parallel supercomputing platforms, but also provides guidance on effective architectural design of future supercomputing systems.",10.25549/usctheses-c127-624895,Computer Science|scientific simulation|multi/many core|parallel computing,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Parallelization framework for scientific application kernels on multi-core/many-core platforms,,

In general, viral protein 40 is the key protein for the oligomerization, the N-terminal loop region in the viral protein 40 and it is essential for the viral replication in Ebola. The electronic structures of native N-terminal loop (His124-Asn134) and metalized (Mn+=Ag+ and Cu2+) complexes are optimized at the M06-2X/LANL2DZ level of theory. Among Mn+-interacted N-loop complexes, Cu2+-interacted N-terminal loop complex has the highest interaction energy of –973.519 kcal/mol and also it has the stabilization energy in the range of 9.92 kcal/mol. The cation-π interactions between His124, Pro131 and Arg134 residues are the important factor, which enhances the interaction energy of viral protein 40. Due to the chelation behavior of metal ions, the backbone and the side chains of N-terminal loop regions are deviated from the planarity that results in the formation of classical hydrogen bonds between N-terminal loop regions. Molecular dynamics simulation studies also revealed that the structural transformations of Nloop into a stable α-helix and β-sheet folded conformations due to the interaction of Ag+ and Cu2+ ions in the N-terminal loop region. The hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the stability and structural changes in N-terminal loop region. Therefore, it is clear that interaction of metal ion with viral protein-40 reduces the replication of the disease by inducing the secondary structural changes. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, the global chromatin landscape and its molecular dynamics in this period remain largely unexplored. Deciphering such process is crucial for understanding both early human development and in vitro fertilization. Here, we investigated genome-wide chromatin accessibility in human preimplantation embryos by employing an improved ATAC-seq that uses as few as 20 cells. We found widespread accessible chromatin in early human embryos that overlaps extensively with putative cis-regulatory sequences and transposable elements. Integrative analyses showed both conservation and divergence in regulatory circuitry between human and mouse early development, and between naïve human pluripotency in vivo and human embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, we also found widespread open chromatin at the 2-cell stage despite its minimal transcription activities. Such accessible chromatin loci are readily found at CpG-rich promoters. Unexpectedly, many others are located in distal regions enriched for transcription factor binding sites and overlap with partially methylated domains (PMDs) in human oocytes. A large portion of these regions then rapidly become inaccessible upon zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Importantly, such drastic transition of chromatin accessibility during ZGA is well conserved in mouse embryos. Furthermore, it strongly correlates with the reprogramming of non-canonical H3K4me3 (ncH3K4me3), a form of histone mark that is uniquely present in oocytes and pre-ZGA embryos and contributes to genome silencing. Finally, both the reprogramming of chromatin accessibility and ncH3K4me3 during ZGA is completely blocked upon transcription inhibition, indicating a critical role of zygotic transcription in shaping early epigenomes. Together, these data revealed conserved chromatin state transition during ZGA in human and mouse early development.

Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sam- pling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfor- tunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncer- tain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation timescales, so proper sampling with cur- rent techniques can require prohibitively long sim- ulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligandis rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over two orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics sim- ulation. This is a first step towards applying this methodology to pharmaceutically-relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding Modes of Ligands using Enhanced Sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.

 A practical computing algorithm working in real time has been developed for calculations of the reflection high-energy electron diffraction from the molecular beam epitaxy growing surface. The calculations are based on a dynamical diffraction theory in which the electrons are scattered on a potential, which is periodic in the direction perpendicular to the surface.

 Nature of problem 
 Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is a very useful technique for studying the growth and the surface analysis of thin epitaxial structures prepared by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The RHEED technique can reveal, almost instantaneously, changes either in the coverage of the sample surface by adsorbates or in the surface structure of a thin film.

It has been shown that in the presence of trans-OMCA, CTAB micelles form long and wormlike micelles, and upon irradiation by UV light, OMCA undergoes a photoisomerization from its trans to its cis form, and the viscosity of the micellar solution is reduced by 4 orders of magnitude. This is feasible mainly due to the alteration of the molecular packing at the micellar interface.

In this research, we address the question of how application programmers can interface with tools and automatically search a space of application-level parameters that are believed to significantly impact the performance of an application. We begin with applications for which a programmer has identified a set of integer-valued parameters believed to impact the performance of the application significantly.; We explore two techniques for modeling performance sensitivity of application-level parameters. First, we propose qualitative parameter models that capture common behaviors of an optimization parameter, and use high-level programmer-specified models of the expected performance behavior of individual parameters. A second modeling technique uses statistical methods on a small sample of parameter values to derive a functional model, and to dynamically identify the neighborhood of the best-performing result. By capitalizing on properties of these models, we develop search algorithms to prune the multi-variate search space for the collection of parameters associated with an application.; We study performance tuning of three large scientific applications: the LS-DYNA Solver, the visualization component of molecular dynamics simulation, and warping component of biomedical image analysis. We validate our models by comparing against performance results from an exhaustive set of experiments across the parameter range. When compared with the exhaustive experimental data, we show that we are able to drastically reduce search time, examining an average of less than 5% of the search space. Our experimental results show speedups of up to 12.83X as compared to the worst-case in user-given parameter ranges, and speedups of up to 1.75X as compared to the user default parameter value.; To support model-guided performance tuning, we have developed a tool called a code isolator. Its purpose is to extract a key computation from the application and creates an executable program, including representative input data. To derive an isolated code fragment that uses storage efficiently and has similar memory hierarchy behavior to the original computation, we develop compiler and runtime optimizations to limit the input data and number of parameters as well as to warm up the cache state. We applied this tool to two case study applications, UMT2K and the LS-DYNA Solver, reducing their size and execution time by several orders of magnitude.; In considering the burden of achieving high performance for developers of current scientific and engineering applications on complex high-end computing platforms, model-guided performance tuning is a feasible and useful tool for finding the best-performing application-level parameters.",10.25549/usctheses-m2398,compiler technique|performance tuning|Computer Science|empirical optimization,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Model-guided performance tuning for application-level parameters,,

However, macroevolutionary analyses based upon molecular phylogenies have difficulty inferring extinction dynamics, raising questions about whether the neontological record can contribute to an understanding of the decline phenomenon. Two recently developed diversification methods for molecular phylogenies (RPANDA and BAMM) incorporate models that theoretically have the capacity to capture decline dynamics by allowing extinction to be higher than speciation. However, the performance of these frameworks over a wide range of decline scenarios has not been studied. Here we investigate the behavior of these methods under decline scenarios caused by decreasing speciation and increasing extinction through time on simulated trees at fixed intervals over diversity trajectories with expansion and decline phases. We also compared method performance over a comprehensive dataset of 214 empirical trees. Our results show that both methods perform equally well when varying speciation rates control decline. When decline was only caused by an increase in extinction rates both methods wrongly assign the variation in net diversification to a drop in speciation, even though the positive gamma values of those trees would suggest otherwise. We also found a tendency for RPANDA to favor increasing extinction and BAMM to favor decreasing speciation as the most common cause of decline in empirical trees. Overall our results shed light on the limitations of both methods, encouraging researchers to carefully interpret the results from diversification studies.",10.5061/dryad.tt10r84,Macroevolution|BAMM|Simulations|Vertebrates|Diversity decline|Extinction|RPANDA|Diversification|Speciation,,,,2018-05-11,DRYAD,Data from: How well can we estimate diversity dynamics for clades in diversity decline?,,

Protein-protein complexes, lasting from microseconds to years, often involve induced-fit, challenging computational or kinetic analysis. Charybdotoxin (CTX), a peptide from the Leiurus scorpion venom, blocks voltage-gated K+-channels in a unique example of binding/unbinding simplicity. CTX plugs the external mouth of K+-channels pore, stopping K+-ion conduction, without inducing conformational changes. Conflicting with a tight binding, we show that external permeant ions enhance CTX-dissociation, implying a path connecting the pore, in the toxin-bound channel, with the external solution. This sensitivity is explained if CTX wobbles between several bound conformations, producing transient events that restore the electrical and ionic trans-pore gradients. Wobbling may originate from a network of contacts in the interaction interface that are in dynamic stochastic equilibria.

Nucleic acids were isolated from blood plasma by phenol de­proteinization and were analyzed by electrophoresis in gradient polyacrylamide gels.

Levels of low-molecular-weight extracellular DNA of blood is significantly increased with the increasing of the dose of irradiation, a direct correlation between the content of that DNA and the radiation dose is established. High efficiency and reliability of the models allows to use them to predict the dose of irradiation. Significant increase of low-molecular-weight DNA in blood was found one day after a single acoustic impact. Elevated levels of low-molecular-weight DNA was maintained 7 days after exposure. Multiple exposure to noise can lead to the greater increase of the level of investigated indicator in blood plasma of experi­mental animals. The influence of both ionizing radiation and low-frequency noise led in increase of level of extracellular low-molecular-weight DNA fraction in rats’ blood.

However, the translational dynamics that link steady-state mRNA with protein levels are not well understood. In this study, we bridge this disconnect by measuring genome-wide translation using ribosome profiling, through five stages of the P. falciparum blood phase developmental cycle. Our findings show that transcription and translation are tightly coupled, with overt translational control occurring for less than 10% of the transcriptome. Translationally regulated genes are predominantly associated with merozoite egress functions. We systematically define mRNA 5′ leader sequences, and 3′ UTRs, as well as antisense transcripts, along with ribosome occupancy for each, and establish that accumulation of ribosomes on 5′ leaders is a common transcript feature.

The current study not only adapts a broad-spectrum strategy for the lucid design of small molecule modulators but also provides novel allosteric inhibitors for DSPI, to investigate its function and potential as a therapeutic target. Docking analysis revealed that the compound 10252273, bound to the specific allosteric site, interacted with Glu118, unique amino acid residue of the active binding pocket, hence indicates the presence of a competitive allosteric site. The current study thus identifies and characterizes inhibitors by targeting the normal binding site and also reports the presence of the competo-allosteric site in the same binding tunnel as the normal site. Molecular docking studies proposed two chemical compounds that share a benzamide-benzimidazole (BB) backbone as potent inhibitors that can obstruct the mechanism of DSPI by targeting both the normal and proposed allosteric binding sites. MD simulations further revealed the disruption of the normal binding site due to the displacement of critical residues Cys146 and Glu118. The rearrangement of H-bond pattern, pi-pi interactions, and strong hydrophobic interactions were observed at both the binding sites. The allosteric pocket inhibitor exhibited improved binding energy than the normal site inhibitor based on MMGBSA and MMPBSA analysis.

Studies presented in this dissertation applied SDSL to investigate the dynamics of large RNAs using a class of nitroxide probes rigidly attached to the parental molecule. This strategy minimizes the “internal” motion arisen from rotations about bonds connecting the radical-bearing moiety to the target molecule, therefore it may enhance sensitivity in certain cases. Two “rigid” nitroxide probes, designated as Ç and RX, were used to investigate how single-stranded junctions modulate the collective segmental motions of a duplex. Studies were carried out in either a 120-kD group I ribozyme derived from Tetrahymena thermophila, or in model systems designated as duplex-junction-duplex. The data indicated that the rigid nitroxides indeed provided enhanced sensitivity in probing segmental motions of the duplex, and were able to reveal that both the sequence and length of the single-stranded junction modulate motional ordering of the attached duplex in the nanosecond regime.

The ancestors of these patients are believed to originate from the southern province of China. Our previous study showed that this mutation leads to reduced abundance of the TPO protein and loss of TPO enzyme activity in a Malaysian-Chinese family with goitrous hypothyroidism. The aim of our study was to provide further data on the incidence of the c.2268dup mutation in a cohort of Malaysian-Chinese and its possible phenotypic effects. Setting: Cohort study. Participants: Twelve biologically unrelated Malaysian-Chinese patients with congenital hypothyroidism were recruited in this study.

,"Frantz, Michael Gideon",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-221655,DATASET,,"The visual system is a premier model for studying experience-dependent plasticity. During development, there’s a period of sensitivity called the ‘critical period’ when brief monocular deprivation (MD) alters ocular dominance (OD) in primary visual cortex (V1). There are several factors thought to mediate the closure of the critical period such as maturation of inhibition, myelination, and molecular cues. One of these molecular cues is the nogo-66 receptor (NgR1), as deletion of ngr1 prevents closure of the critical period for OD plasticity and allows for recovery of visual acuity in adulthood following long-term monocular deprivation (LTMD). ❧ NgR1’s restriction of neurite outgrowth in vitro led to the hypothesis that NgR1 restricts developmental visual plasticity by restricting the rates of addition and loss of axonal boutons, as explored in chapter 2. Chronic in-vivo 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) has become a standard for observing experience-dependent changes in anatomical plasticity over time in vivo. Various experiential manipulations have elicited changes in dendritic spine dynamics in different cortical areas, including visual cortex. However, the effect of altered experience on axonal bouton dynamics had not been studied prior to the paper published in chapter 2, where I asked whether 4D MD or recovery of visual acuity was accompanied by altered axonal bouton dynamics in ngr1-/- mice. I found that neither alteration in visual experince affected the rates of axonal bouton gain and loss in V1. This supports a model where anatomical changes correlating with functional visual plasticity are largely postsynaptic while axonal structures remain relatively stable. ❧ Visual cortex is subdivided into lamina. It remains poorly understood whether each layer plays a different role in the expression of OD plasticity. In cats, layer IV is relatively resistant to OD shifts, although this is not true in mice, as shifts in layer IV have been recorded in as little as 1D. In chapter 3, I examined whether removing the brakes on plasticity in individual layers using conditional deletion of ngr1 unmasks plasticity in adults. I also examined how shifts in OD progressed in a laminar fashion. I found that deleting ngr1 in excitatory neurons of layer IV enabled OD plasticity throughout all layers through a disinhibitory circuit. Further, in mice lacking ngr1 in layer IV and critical period WT mice, 2D MD produced a dramatic shift in eye dominance in layer IV with only modest shifts in layers II/III and V.

,"Wei, Tao",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1641,DATASET,,"Unrestricted The studies of protein adsorption at solid-liquid interface are important in various applications. Multilayer and irreversible adsorption behaviors are commonly observed. In this work, protein adsorption behavior at the solid-liquid interface was investigated by a combination of experimental Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) studies and computer simulations: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and hybrid Genetic-Algorithm (GA) schemes.; BSA, lysozyme, IgG and fibrinogen adsorption was studied with FTIR/ATR in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffers on a Ge surface. Buffer choice was shown to drastically affect adsorption kinetics. In comparison with Tris-HCl, PBS buffer depresses the adsorption of BSA, IgG and fibrinogen in the prolonged quasi-linear kinetic region while lysozyme adsorption is relatively insensitive to buffer choice. Buffer concentration can also significantly affect protein adsorption. The secondary structures in the adsorbed phase are generally quite different from the bulk structure; however, buffer choice has negligible effect on structural evolution. Significant secondary structure changes occur during adsorption. The secondary structures in the adsorbed phase are inhomogeneous. The role of phosphate ions in PBS buffer and their effect on protein adsorption are rather complex. Phosphate ions adsorb competitively against protein molecules and their deprotonation equilibrium can be altered at the solid-liquid interface due to the adsorbed protein.; The effect of surface on adsorption is examined by adsorbing IgG on various polymer-coated surfaces. IgG adsorption is higher on more hydrophobic surface. IgG molecules adsorbed in layers near hydrophilic solid surfaces suffer less secondary structure changes.; The behavior of lysozyme during adsorption on a hydrogen-terminated Si surface (Si-H) is studied using MD simulations. Although atomistic simulations are highly time-consuming for direct observations of complete secondary structure changes, indications of molecular deformations are observed over nanosecond simulation time scale. Lysozyme molecule undergoes deformation onto the Si-H surface, as is evidenced by the reduction in the volume, the increase in solvent accessible surface area, the change of the overall shape, and certain amount of alteration in secondary structures. The main α-helix domains experience some loss while the beta-sheet domains remain almost intact. The hydrophobic character of the surface is believed to contribute to the loss of the organized structures of the amino residues in close proximity to the surface.; An efficient hybrid GA/spatial-grid method was developed to search for low adsorption-energy orientations and locations of a protein molecule on a solid surface. The surface and the protein molecule are treated as rigid bodies, whereas the bulk fluid is represented by spatial grids. The hybrid search procedure consists of two interlinked loops. In 1st loop (A), a GA is employed to identify promising regions for the global energy minimum, whereas a local optimizer with the derivative-free Nelder-Mead method is used to search for the lowest-energy orientation within the identified regions.

,"Clark, Richard",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3079,DATASET,,"Unrestricted This dissertation uses multi-million atom molecular dynamics simulations to determine the key mechanisms which control the oxidation of aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) due to uniform heating.  The primary simulation studied is the oxidation of a 46 nm ANP uniformly heated to 1100 K (the melting temperature of aluminum metal is 933 K).  In this system, 3 stages are identified, corresponding to simulation times of 0 to 50 ps (Stage 1), 60 to 110 ps (Stage 2), and 120 to 1000 ps (Stage 3).  Radial analysis, fragment analysis, and other simulation tools are used to determine the controlling mechanisms in each stage, as well as determining the cause of each stage transition.  Stage 1, initiated by the ANP temperature exceeding the melting temperature of the aluminum core, is seen to be a confined burning stage.  Oxygen penetrating from the core-shell interface reacts exothermically with the core metal, releasing local heat.  When this heating drives the local temperature of the shell to exceed the melting temperature of alumina (the shell), a sudden increase in the number of oxidation reactions is seen.  The development of asymmetry in the shell and increased uptake of oxygen from the exterior also support the conclusion that melting of the shell initiates Stage 2.  Local heating continues until the shell temperature reaches a critical temperature (T = 3000 K), at which point aluminum atom ejections from the exterior of the shell into the surrounding oxygen begin.  These ejections lead to direct oxidation outside the ANP and the formation of oxygen-rich clusters.  Both internal and external oxidation continue throughout the remainder of Stage 3, leading to complete oxidation of the particle.; After having determined the basic mechanisms in the 46nm simulation, the effect of initial temperature on the oxidation stages is studied.  Three 26nm ANP simulation systems, heated to 1100 K, 1200 K, and 1400 K, are analyzed using the tools developed in the preceding study.  By comparing these systems, it is determined that many of the features identified in the model are strongly dependent on the initial temperature of the nanoparticle (including the time delay to the onset of each stage and the rate of oxidation in stages 2 and 3), while others have a relatively small dependence on the initial temperature provided (including the initial rate of heating, the rate of aluminum ejections in stage 3, and the overall temperature of a system of a given size).; Finally, the tools and models developed in this study are applied to the case of a flash-heated ANP, providing a comparison point to aid in the understanding of this more complicated reaction.  From this, it is determined that the initial heating of flash-heated ANPs is dominated by a mechanical mixing mechanism resulting from the pressure-driven volume expansion of the flash-heated core.  This volume expansion significantly increases the chemical reaction zone of the core-shell oxidation, resulting in the very fast release of energy seen in the flash-heating cases.",10.25549/usctheses-m3079,aluminum nanoparticle|Voter-Chen embedded atom method|atomistic simulation|semi-classical potential|Vashishta 3-body potential|molecular dynamics|Physics,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Heat-initiated oxidation of aluminum nanoparticles,,

research project to build genetic database of wild Bengal tigers of Nepal. NTGP
is a collaborative effort of Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal
Government’s Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation, Department of National
Parks and Wildlife Conservation, University of Idaho and Virginia Tech
University. The project introduced latest genetic technology in Nepal for
wildlife conservation and has built Nepal’s first geo-spatial genetic database
of Bengal tigers from throughout the Terai Arc landscape. NTGP was made
possible through generous funding support of the American people through
USAID/Nepal under Fixed Obligation Grant (FOG) no. AID-367-G-11-00001. 

Conservation of the Bengal tigers in Nepal is a top priority due to
its dwindling number of species worldwide. 
It is important to have a comprehensive understanding of tiger
conservation from a landscape perspective. 
In order to develop effective policies and strategies for the conservation
of Bengal tigers, effective census tools need to be developed and deployed. The
conventional tools for conservation are often inadequate and ineffective to
address the problem.

NTGP introduced the latest in non-invasive genetic technology to address
many challenges of tiger conservation in Nepal. Due to its high specificity and
sensitivity, information obtained through a genetic study is more detailed than
conventionally gathered data. It can also be applied to understand landscape
genetics of the species which has great utility for developing overall
conservation policies and strategies on a landscape scale.  In addition to introducing new genetic
technology in Nepal, NTGP also enhanced existing laboratory capacity and
fostered an environment of conservation research collaboration in a global
scale. 

A comprehensive Bengal tiger genetic database has been created with
detailed field, laboratory and genetic information on confirmed tiger samples.
This elaborate searchable database is designed to be highly secure and
accessible only to the government with CMDN being the caretaker of the
information; this database has a greater utility for wildlife research and
forensic purposes.

NTGP has been able to leave a long lasting impact in the field of
conservation genetics in Nepal.  The
project itself has trained 75 local experts, created 43 jobs, brought in
experts from 4 countries, and helped in five other similar researches in

Furthermore, the subtleties of the reactive surfaces and the effect of external forces such as solvent electrostatics and molecular collisions on these surfaces often play a major role in the reaction outcome.  Many of these external effects begin influencing the reaction within tens of femtoseconds, requiring sophisticated experimental techniques in order to observe dynamics on these timescales.; Ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy is employed to study the benchmark ICN Ã photodissociation reaction.  This prototypical triatomic system is known to produce a highly non-equilibrium distribution of rotationally excited cyano radicals.  The generation of these rotors comes from a non-adiabatic transition which applies extra torque to an already rapidly bending I-CN bond and leads to two product states corresponding to the I*(²P1/2) + cold CN and I(²P3/2) + hot CN channel.  Simulations show that this rotationally excited CN pushes solvent molecules out of the way to create a cavity where free rotation takes place for several picoseconds.  Our hypothesis is that this spinning CN resembles a gas phase molecule, and thus should have a gas phase spectral signature.; Although the relaxation of the hot CN takes place on relatively long time scales for ultrafast spectroscopists, the initial curve crossing event takes place much earlier (&lt;30 fs) and not much is known about the influence of the solvent on this process.  Using sub 40 fs DUV pulses compressed by a novel Gires-Tournois pulse compression system and multiplexed  broadband probing, we can interrogate this reaction at much higher levels of detail than previously possible.  A clear signature from the gas-phase-like CN B←X transition is observed in both water and ethanol.  The spectral contributions of I(²P3/2)  and I*(²P1/2)  can be removed from the transient spectrum, because of new and independent experiments also reported here that capture these spectra by photodetachment of iodide in ethanol.  This analysis allows us to watch the evolution of the CN band and estimate first pass curve-crossing probabilities for the first time in solution.; Semiclassical molecular dynamics simulations of ICN bond breaking in water including the non-adiabatic transition, allow us to microscopically break down the energy flow which takes place immediately after dissociation.  Using a spectroscopic sorting criteria which follows only freely dissociated trajectories, we can compare the simulation directly to our experimental observables for the first time.; Future work is needed to measure the equilibrium spectrum of the CN radical in the absence of iodine transients as a last reference, but, with our current time resolution and the ability to simultaneously image the absorption spectrum of multiple transient species as a function of time, we are much closer to extracting all pertinent information from a movie of this benchmark solution phase reaction occurring in real time.",10.25549/usctheses-m3636,spectroscopy|pump-probe|Chemistry (Chemical Physics)|molecular dynamics|time-resolved|photodissociation|ultrafast,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Ultrafast spectroscopic interrogation and simulation of excited states and reactive surfaces,,

During development, there’s a period of sensitivity called the ‘critical period’ when brief monocular deprivation (MD) alters ocular dominance (OD) in primary visual cortex (V1). There are several factors thought to mediate the closure of the critical period such as maturation of inhibition, myelination, and molecular cues. One of these molecular cues is the nogo-66 receptor (NgR1), as deletion of ngr1 prevents closure of the critical period for OD plasticity and allows for recovery of visual acuity in adulthood following long-term monocular deprivation (LTMD). ❧ NgR1’s restriction of neurite outgrowth in vitro led to the hypothesis that NgR1 restricts developmental visual plasticity by restricting the rates of addition and loss of axonal boutons, as explored in chapter 2. Chronic in-vivo 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) has become a standard for observing experience-dependent changes in anatomical plasticity over time in vivo. Various experiential manipulations have elicited changes in dendritic spine dynamics in different cortical areas, including visual cortex. However, the effect of altered experience on axonal bouton dynamics had not been studied prior to the paper published in chapter 2, where I asked whether 4D MD or recovery of visual acuity was accompanied by altered axonal bouton dynamics in ngr1-/- mice. I found that neither alteration in visual experince affected the rates of axonal bouton gain and loss in V1. This supports a model where anatomical changes correlating with functional visual plasticity are largely postsynaptic while axonal structures remain relatively stable. ❧ Visual cortex is subdivided into lamina. It remains poorly understood whether each layer plays a different role in the expression of OD plasticity. In cats, layer IV is relatively resistant to OD shifts, although this is not true in mice, as shifts in layer IV have been recorded in as little as 1D. In chapter 3, I examined whether removing the brakes on plasticity in individual layers using conditional deletion of ngr1 unmasks plasticity in adults. I also examined how shifts in OD progressed in a laminar fashion. I found that deleting ngr1 in excitatory neurons of layer IV enabled OD plasticity throughout all layers through a disinhibitory circuit. Further, in mice lacking ngr1 in layer IV and critical period WT mice, 2D MD produced a dramatic shift in eye dominance in layer IV with only modest shifts in layers II/III and V.

 Nature of problem 
 In many areas of physics, knowing diffusion coefficients is vital and gives useful information about the physical properties of diffusive particles and the environment. In many cases a diffusive particle is not a sphere and has rotation during its movements. In these cases information about a particle's trajectory both in lab and body frame would be useful. Also some statistical analysis is needed to obtain more information about a particle's motion.

The accuracy of these methods depends on both an adequate underlying model and the appropriate implementation of fossil evidence as calibration points. We explore the effect of these in Poaceae (grasses), a diverse plant lineage with a very limited fossil record, focusing particularly on dating the early divergences in the group. We show that molecular dating based on a dataset of plastid markers is strongly dependent on the model assumptions. In particular, an acceleration of evolutionary rates at the base of Poaceae followed by a deceleration in the descendants strongly biases methods that assume an autocorrelation of rates. This problem can be circumvented by using markers that have lower rate variation, and we show that phylogenetic markers extracted from complete nuclear genomes can be a useful complement to the more commonly used plastid markers. However, estimates of divergence times remain strongly affected by different implementations of fossil calibration points. Analyses calibrated with only macrofossils lead to estimates for the age of core Poaceae around 51-55 Ma, but the inclusion of microfossil evidence pushes this age to 74-82 Ma and leads to lower estimated evolutionary rates in grasses.

Lastly, a QSAR study to obtain deeper knowledge of the contribution of the proposed methods was carried out, using four molecular datasets (steroids (STER), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thermolysin inhibitors (THER) and thrombin inhibitors (THR)) widely used as benchmarks in the evaluation of several methodologies. One to four variable QSAR models based on multiple linear regression were developed for each compound dataset following the original division into training and test sets. The results obtained reveal that the novel cutoff procedures yield superior performances relative to those of the QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs in the prediction of the biological activities considered. From the results achieved, it can be suggested that the proposed N-tuple topological/geometric cutoffs constitute a relevant criteria for generating MDs codifying particular atomic relations, ultimately useful in enhancing the modelling capacity of the QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs.",10.6084/m9.figshare.3988881.v1,59999 Environmental Sciences not elsewhere classified|Biotechnology|19999 Mathematical Sciences not elsewhere classified|Genetics|39999 Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified|69999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified|Biophysics|Computational  Biology|Cell Biology,,,,2016-01-01,figshare.ars,"N-tuple topological/geometric cutoffs for 3D N-linear algebraic molecular codifications: variability, linear independence and QSAR analysis",,

research project to build genetic database of wild Bengal tigers of Nepal. NTGP
is a collaborative effort of Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal
Government’s Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation, Department of National
Parks and Wildlife Conservation, University of Idaho and Virginia Tech
University. The project introduced latest genetic technology in Nepal for
wildlife conservation and has built Nepal’s first geo-spatial genetic database
of Bengal tigers from throughout the Terai Arc landscape. NTGP was made
possible through generous funding support of the American people through
USAID/Nepal under Fixed Obligation Grant (FOG) no. AID-367-G-11-00001. 

Conservation of the Bengal tigers in Nepal is a top priority due to
its dwindling number of species worldwide. 
It is important to have a comprehensive understanding of tiger
conservation from a landscape perspective. 
In order to develop effective policies and strategies for the conservation
of Bengal tigers, effective census tools need to be developed and deployed. The
conventional tools for conservation are often inadequate and ineffective to
address the problem.

NTGP introduced the latest in non-invasive genetic technology to address
many challenges of tiger conservation in Nepal. Due to its high specificity and
sensitivity, information obtained through a genetic study is more detailed than
conventionally gathered data. It can also be applied to understand landscape
genetics of the species which has great utility for developing overall
conservation policies and strategies on a landscape scale.  In addition to introducing new genetic
technology in Nepal, NTGP also enhanced existing laboratory capacity and
fostered an environment of conservation research collaboration in a global
scale. 

A comprehensive Bengal tiger genetic database has been created with
detailed field, laboratory and genetic information on confirmed tiger samples.
This elaborate searchable database is designed to be highly secure and
accessible only to the government with CMDN being the caretaker of the
information; this database has a greater utility for wildlife research and
forensic purposes.

NTGP has been able to leave a long lasting impact in the field of
conservation genetics in Nepal.  The
project itself has trained 75 local experts, created 43 jobs, brought in
experts from 4 countries, and helped in five other similar researches in
Nepal.",10.6084/m9.figshare.5896063.v1,"60411 Population, Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics",,,,2018-01-01,figshare.ars,"Assessment of genetic diversity, population structure, and gene flow of tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) across Nepal's Terai Arc Landscape",,

For example, fibrils of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), α-synuclein, and amyloid-β are pathological hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. Understanding of fibril structure and that of the protofilaments that constitute the fibrils will help to reveal the mechanism of fibril formation in human diseases and to facilitate therapeutic intervention. However, the fibril structures of full-length amyloid proteins/peptides are difficult to determine by direct experimental approaches since they are neither soluble nor crystallizable. ❧ The goals of this thesis are to develop algorithms, programs and protocols for the modeling and determination of amyloid fibril structures based on experimental data mainly obtained from election paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electron microscopy (EM), and then to use the resulting models for explaining previously unclear aspects of the experimental data and for aiding experimental design to obtain more structural details of the amyloid fibrils. ❧ In the thesis work, a simulation protocol for modeling amyloid protofilaments mainly based on EPR data was developed. This protocol was demonstrated to be able to produce structures of hIAPP protofilaments consistent with the experimental data. Then, to investigate the properties of the protofilament structures obtained and to generate fibril models consisting of more than one protofilament, a new program, MFIBRIL, was developed for flexible construction of fibrils from a monomeric unit. Several potential models of the hIAPP fibril were constructed using MFIBRIL and then refined by equilibration using molecular dynamics simulations in the NAMD software package. The refined models were evaluated by predicting the ring-to-ring distances using the MFIBRIL analysis tool and the inter-spin label distances and residue mobilities using PRONOX (another program developed in our laboratory) and comparing the predictions to the experimental data. This work led to identification of a favorable hIAPP fibril model consisting of two protofilaments with strong hydrophobic interactions between I26 and V32 surrounding hydrophilic interactions between S28 and T30 in the second β-strand (C-terminal) regions. The programs and protocols developed in this work are applicable to structural determination of other amyloid fibrils. ❧ In addition to the modeling of amyloid fibrils, two other projects are described in the thesis. The first is addition to the solvation function of WATGEN (a program developed in our laboratory for modeling the water network at protein-peptide interfaces) to protein-RNA interfaces and investigation of the features of solvated protein-RNA interfaces. The second project involves modeling of the transport mechanism of the human dipeptide transporter (hPEPT1).",10.25549/usctheses-c3-234407,human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP)|protein assemblies|MFIBRIL|molecular modeling|Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology|algorithm,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Algorithm development for modeling protein assemblies,,

The present work focuses on the construction and application of two distinct techniques for the simulation of such systems. These methods involve large-scale changes in the system configuration and have the potential to be applicable to a variety of systems. These methods were used to study the critical behavior in a Sine-Gordon lattice model and for achieving enhanced conformational sampling in an all-atom model of proteins. ❧ A novel switching algorithm is described in which a reverse Monte Carlo method is implemented. Here, the potential is stochastically modified before the system configuration is moved. This new algorithm facilitates a generalized formulation of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods, and the generalization makes it possible to derive cluster algorithms for systems with both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. This Reverse Monte Carlo has been applied to study the roughening transition in the Sine-Gordon model and high-accuracy simulations for system sizes up to 1024X1024 were carried out to examine the logarithmic divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature. This logarithmic divergence is a clear evidence that the transition belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless type. ❧ Proteins and other biomolecules like RNAs are extremely difficult systems to simulate because of the large system sizes involved and the complexity of interactions present. The time-scales over which interesting phenomena occur also makes it difficult for Molecular Dynamics techniques to do full justice in such systems. A loop closure Monte Carlo algorithm is derived and implemented for simulation of proteins at ambient temperatures. The loop closure method generates alternative structures for an internal segment of a chain when atomic coordinates of the atoms outside the segment are fixed. The formulation makes use of a novel representation of boundary constraints and allows the loop closure problem to be reduced in complexity from a 6-variable 6-constraint problem to a 4-variable 4-constraint problem. The proposed method is no longer limited to small loops, but can be used to close loops of arbitrarily large sizes. This brings to life the possibility to facilitate very large conformational sampling with each move.",10.25549/usctheses-c127-621759,Chemistry|Monte Carlo|proteins|stochastic potential switching|sine gordon|critical slowing down|loop closure,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Applications of loop closure and stochastic potential switching to Monte Carlo simulations of large systems,,

Mutations in SF3B1 are associated with 80% cases of refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS), a subtype of MDS. SF3B1K700E is the most frequently mutated site among mutations on SF3B1. Yet the molecular mechanisms on how mutations of splicing factors lead to defective erythropoiesis are not clear. SF3B1K700E mutant binds to an RNA binding protein, RBM15, stronger than the wild type SF3B1 protein in co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, K700E mutant alters the RNA splicing of transcription factors TAL1 and GATA1. Via alternative RNA splicing, a novel short TAL1 transcript variant (TAL1s) is generated. Enhanced interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 promotes the production of full-length TAL1 (TAL1fl) mRNA, while reduction of RBM15 protein level via PRMT1-mediated degradation pathway changes TAL1s/TAL1fl ratio in favor of TAL1s. TAL1s contains the helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain but not the N terminal region upstream of the DNA binding domain. The TAL1s protein loses its interaction with ETO2, which represses early erythropoiesis. In this vein, overexpression of TAL1s stimulates the transcription of β-hemoglobin in human leukemia K562 cells and promotes erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured in erythropoietin-containing medium.

The first data set, employed as a training set, was proposed by Ouyang (Ouyang and Liang, 2008) and contains 80 proteins (the case “2BLM” was removed since it only considered an alpha carbon representation). The second dataset, employed as a test set, was proposed by Ruiz-Blanco (Ruiz-Blanco et al., 2015) and contains 17 proteins.
SI3-4: For the generation of the models, a dataset of 204 proteins was employed. (Chou, 1999) The original dataset was split into two groups: a training set with 149 proteins and a test set containing 55 proteins to ensure a proper comparison (Marrero Ponce et al., 2015a)

P.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8518,SOFTWARE_CODE|DATASET,2011-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Comparative genomic data among organisms allow the reconstruction of their phylogenies and evolutionary time scales. Molecular timings have been recently used to suggest that environmental global change have shaped the evolutionary history of diverse terrestrial organisms. Living xenarthrans (armadillos, anteaters and sloths) constitute an ideal model for studying the influence of past environmental changes on species diversification. Indeed, extant xenarthran species are relicts from an evolutionary radiation enhanced by their isolation in South America during the Tertiary era, a period for which major climate variations and tectonic events are relatively well documented.

RESULTS: We applied a Bayesian approach to three nuclear genes in order to relax the molecular clock assumption while accounting for differences in evolutionary dynamics among genes and incorporating paleontological uncertainties. We obtained a molecular time scale for the evolution of extant xenarthrans and other placental mammals. Divergence time estimates provide substantial evidence for contemporaneous diversification events among independent xenarthran lineages. This correlated pattern of diversification might possibly relate to major environmental changes that occurred in South America during the Cenozoic.

CONCLUSIONS: The observed synchronicity between planetary and biological events suggests that global change played a crucial role in shaping the evolutionary history of extant xenarthrans. Our findings open ways to test this hypothesis further in other South American mammalian endemics like hystricognath rodents, platyrrhine primates, and didelphid marsupials.",10.5061/dryad.8518,Sloths|Xenarthrans|Armadillos|Phylogeny|Molecular dating|Diversification|Supermatrix|Anteaters,"Lab.

Kingman's coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the effective population size as a function of time.  Major goals of demographic reconstruction include identifying driving factors of effective population size, and understanding the association between the effective population size and such factors.  Building upon Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible framework that incorporates time-varying covariates that exploit Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of effective population size trajectories.  To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models.  Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories.  Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics.  We apply our model to four examples.  We reconstruct the demographic history of raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak.  Next, we examine the effective population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns.  We compare the population history of the HIV-1 CRF02_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective of incidence rate.

Compared with annual herbaceous plants, flowering is the premise of fruit bearing. The flowering of woody apple trees is relatively late because of its long juvenile phase that greatly affects the genetic improvement process of these plants. To better understand the molecular regulation of floral transition and flower development in red-fleshed apple, we isolated and characterized a floral MADS-box gene, MdAGL24-like, in this paper. MdAGL24-like shares sequence similarity with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) from other species. It’s dynamically expressed in flowers, followed by roots and fruits. Like other transcript factors, MdAGL24-like was localized in the nucleus. MdAGL24-like could interact with MdSOC1 and MdAP1 in vivo and in vitro. MdAGL24-like and MdSOC1 could increase each other’s expression by binding the CArG motifs in their promoters. Unlike MdSOC1, MdAGL24-like couldn’t directly bind the downstream gene MdLFY. Ectopic overexpression of MdAGL24-like in wild-type Arabidopsis induced early flowering similar to the phenotypes induced by other AGL24 genes. Like AGL24 in Arabidopsis, MdAGL24-like could somewhat rescue the late-flowering phenotype of agl24. These results would clarify the molecular mechanism underlying flowering and provide a method of shortening the juvenile period in red-fleshed apples and other fruit trees.

We also find that the diffusive motion of multiple slip links along chromatin is rectified by an intriguing ratchet effect that arises if slip links bind to the chromatin at a preferred 'loading site'.

The library is based on OpenFOAM and enhances the general-purpose LES solvers provided by this software with state-of-the-art wall modelling capability. The included wall models belong to the class of wall-stress models that account for the under-resolved turbulent structures by predicting and enforcing the correct local value of the wall shear stress. A review of this approach is given, followed by a detailed description of the library, discussing its functionality and extensible design. The included wall-stress models are presented, based on both algebraic and ordinary differential equations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the library, it was used for WMLES of turbulent channel flow and the flow over a backward-facing step (BFS). For each flow, a systematic simulation campaign was performed, in order to find a combination of numerical schemes, grid resolution and wall model type that would yield a good predictive accuracy for both the mean velocity field in the outer layer of the TBLs and the mean wall shear stress. The best result, ~1% error in the above quantities, was achieved for channel flow using a mildly dissipative second-order accurate scheme for the convective fluxes applied on an isotropic grid with 27000 cells per d^3-cube, where d is the channel half-height. In the case of flow over a BFS, this combination led to the best agreement with experimental data. An algebraic model based on Spalding’s law of the wall was found to perform well for both flows. On the other hand, the tested more complicated models, which incorporate the pressure gradient in the wall shear stress prediction, led to less accurate results.",10.17632/m8dnsnp4nd.1,Computational Physics|Computational Fluid Dynamics|Modelling,,Computational Physics|Computational Fluid Dynamics|Modelling,,2019-02-21,MENDELEY_DATA,A library for wall-modelled large-eddy simulation based on OpenFOAM technology,article,1

Methods: This study analyzed a cohort of 107 adult patients with diffuse gliomas, WHO grades II and III and glioblastoma, by immunohistochemistry for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked (ATRX) mutations, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 1p/19q co-deletions and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing for TERTp mutation. Further, five glioma molecular sub-groups were derived using three molecular alterations and included the sub-groups with: i) IDH mutations only, ii) IDH and TERTp mutation only, iii) IDH and 1p/19q co-deletion only, iv) Triple negative and v) Triple positive.  
Results: IDH mutations and 1p/19q co-deletions were individually and significantly associated with an improved progression free (p=0.001 and p=0.002 respectively) and overall survival (p=0.000 and p=0.005 respectively) in the present cohort of gliomas.

The basic unit of the nervous system is a neuron, composed of a cell body and a number of processes called neurites in immature neurons. In mature neurons, these processes have become dendrites, which collect information, and axons, which send information from the cell body to a downstream partner. To accomplish highly sophisticated tasks like walking, talking, or playing the piano, individual neurons are ordered into precisely arranged circuits which integrate and analyze sensory information relevant for that specific task, select and produce motor behaviors, and modify synaptic connections during learning. ❧ Developing precisely organized circuits requires individual growing axons to use a flexible tip structure called a growth cone to follow specific paths through the immature nervous system as they elongate and eventually form synapses onto specific targets. Growth cones are steered by a combination of external guidance cues and internal molecular mechanisms, and may split to extend into multiple regions. Eventually, growth cones reach their destination and form a synapse where they can pass information to their downstream partner—either another neuron or a responsive tissue, like muscle fiber. Additional refinement of axonal branching, stability and synaptic strength can occur later in development, during critical periods of learning, or throughout life. ❧ Connections established during development and learning determine a neuron's function: for example, a neuron which receives multiple inputs from a variety of sensory receptors could function as an information integrator, while a neuron with branching axons can efficiently coordinate downstream partners by sending identical information to multiple places. Entire pathways through successive brain regions can also be arranged to maintain a specific organization—for example, medial regions may project to downstream medial regions, while lateral regions project to lateral regions. Because neurons are often arranged into maps according to their properties, maintaining the organization of axonal projections between brain areas throughout a circuit can preserve the organization of information processed in successive brain areas. Information carried along parallel pathways can then be integrated at a point of convergence, where signals can be added together, compared, evaluated, or modified before the information is sent forward. ❧ This dissertation addresses two central questions about neural circuits: how are neural circuits organized to mediate specific functions, and what molecular mechanisms regulate neurite growth during development? In the following sections in this chapter, I review the current literature about neural circuitry mediating vocal learning in songbirds and insights into how the structural organization of a circuit enables this complex developmental behavior. I also review current literature about molecular mechanisms which regulate the growth of neurons during development. In chapter 2, I describe my work using a systems-level investigation into the organization of songbird neural circuits that enable multimodal vocal learning and inter-hemispheric coordination. In chapters 3 and 4, I describe my work developing and using a novel method for quantifying microtubule dynamics within growing neurons to investigate a molecular mechanism for regulating neurite branching during development.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-335848,"cytoskeleton|plus-tip proteins|inter-hemispheric|songbird|color-coded display|growth cone branching|bilateral coordination|cortical circuits|Genetic, Molecular and Cellular Biology|avian|anterior commissure|computer vision|fluorescent microscopy|sensory systems",,,,2017-01-01,usc.dl,Cortical circuits for vocal learning and microtubule dynamics in neural development,,

The phenomena occur at the pore scale and are greatly influenced by the heterogeneity of the pore space morphology. In this thesis salt precipitation is studied at two scales: molecular and pore scales. First, we use molecular dynamic simulation to study evaporation and salt precipitation in a single pore. Salt crystals precipitate on the pores' surface, modify the pore space morphology, and reduce its flow and transport properties. Despite numerous efforts to understand the mechanisms of nucleation of salt crystals in confined media, the effect of the rock's chemistry, which is mostly clay,on the growth, distribution and properties of the crystals is not well understood. We report the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulation of nucleation and growth of NaCl crystals in a clay pore usingmolecular models of two types of clay minerals, the Na-montmorillonite and kaolinite. Clear evidence is presented for the nucleation of the salt crystals that indicates that the molecular structure of clay minerals affects their spatial distribution, although the nucleation mechanism is the same in both types of clays. ❧ We then develop a pore-network model of flow of brine, and salt transport and precipitation in porous medis. To carry our efficient simulations with large pore networks, one must develop new computational algorithm. The computation time and required memory are two limiting factors that hinder the scalability of the computations to very large network sizes. We present a dual approach, based on the use of a combination of the central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), to simulation of flow, transport, and similar problems using pore networks. A mixed-precision algorithm, together with the conjugate-gradient method is implemented on a single GPU solver. The efficiency of the method is tested with a variety of cases, including pore- and random-resistor network models in which the conductances are long-range correlated, and also contain percolation disorder. Both isotropic and anisotropic networks are considered. To put the method to a stringent test, the long-range correlations are generated by a fractional Brownian motion (FBM), which we generate by a message-passing interface method. For all the cases studied an overall speed-up factor of about one order of magnitude or better is obtained, which increases with the size of the network that one can use. Even the critical slow-down in networks near the percolation threshold does not decrease the speed-up significantly. We also obtain approximate but accurate bounds for the permeability anisotropy Kₓ/Kᵧ [K sub x over K sub y] for stratified porous media. ❧ Before developing a pore-network model for salt transport and precipitation, one must also develop anmodel for evaporation in porous media. At the pore-scale, a threshold capillary pressure Pᵧ ∽ ɣ/aₜ is needed for the invading (vapor) phase at the throat entrance in order to expel the wetting fluid from a throat/pore in a porous medium. The threshold pressure depends on the interfacial tension ɣ between the wetting and non-wetting fluids and the entrance wetting radius rₜ of the throat/pore. Isotropic and homogeneous porous media consist of throats/pores of a sole average radius and, hence, the threshold capillary pressure usually outweighs the flow-induced viscous pressure in apore. Thus, a minimal variation in rₜ changes the fluid phase distribution and transport properties of the porous medium during drainage invasion/drainage process. Natural porous media, such as geological formations, are stratified, consisting of more or less parallel layers, with each layer having a different morphological properties. The extra variations in the pore space strongly affects flow andtransport in porous media. Thus, we develop a three-dimensional pore-network model of evaporation inlayered porous media, in which we use a fractional Brownian motion (FBM) to include the impact of the pore-size disorder, heterogeneity, and correlations. Our simulations indicate that diffusion of theevaporating phase, drying patterns of liquid, and saturation profiles are all affected strongly by the correlations and disorder in pore space, and that, while the increase in the stochasticity of thepore sizes stabilizes the drying front, the increase in the anisotropy parameter results in a more disordered drying front. ❧ We then present a pore-network model to study salt transport and precipitation in pores media. Vapor diffusion, capillary effect at the brine-vapor interface, flow of brine, and transport of salt and its precipitation in the pores that plug the pores partially or completely are all accounted for. The drying process is modeled by the invasion percolation, while transport of salt in brine is accounted for by the convective-diffusion equation. We demonstrate that the drying patterns, the clustering and connectivity of the pore throats in which salt precipitation occurs, the saturation distribution, and the drying rate are all strongly dependent upon the pore-size distribution, the correlations among the pore sizes, and the anisotropy of the pore space caused by stratification that most natural porous media contain. In particular, if the strata are more or less parallel to the direction of injection of the gas that dries out the pore space (air, for example) and/or causes salt precipitation (CO₂, for example), the drying rate increases significantly. Moreover, salt tends to precipitate in clusters of neighboring pores that are parallel to the open surface of the porous medium. ❧ In order to demonstrate the existence of the heterogeneity, correlations and long-range correlations in large-scale porous medium, we also study the well logs of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Archie's law expresses a relation between the formation factor F of porous media and their porosity ϕ, F∝ϕ⁻ᵐ, where m is the Archie or the cementation exponent. Despite widespread use of Archie's law, the value of m and whether it is universal and independent of the type of reservoir have remained controversial.

The core part of the software is the real-time, real-space calculation of the electron dynamics induced in molecules and solids by an external electric field solving the time-dependent Kohn–Sham equation. Using a weak instantaneous perturbing field, linear response properties such as polarizabilities and photoabsorptions in isolated systems and dielectric functions in periodic systems are determined.

The propagation of the laser pulse in bulk solids and thin films can also be included in the simulation via coupling the electron dynamics in many microscopic unit cells using Maxwell’s equations describing the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields.

Extensively available multicore clusters have influenced hybrid message-passing and multithreading parallel algorithms to become a standard parallelization for modern clusters. However, hybrid parallel applications of portable scalability on emerging high-end multicore clusters consisting of multimillion cores are yet to be accomplished. Achieving scalability on emerging multicore platforms is an enormous challenge, since we do not even know the architecture of future platforms, with new hardware features such as hardware transactional memory (HTM) constantly being deployed. Scalable implementation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on massively parallel computers has been one of the major driving forces of supercomputing technologies. Especially, recent advancements in reactive MD simulations based on many-body interatomic potentials have necessitated efficient dynamic n-tuple computation. Hence, it is of great significance now to develop scalable hybrid n-tuple computation algorithms to provide a viable foundation for high-performance parallel-computing software on forthcoming architectures. ❧ This dissertation research develops a scalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading algorithm for n-tuple MD simulation, which will continue to scale on future architectures (i.e. achieving metascalability). The two major goals of this dissertation research are: (1) design a scalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading parallel algorithmic framework on multicore architectures and evaluate it on most advanced parallel architectures; and (2) develop a computation-pattern algebraic framework to design scalable algorithms for general n-tuple computation and prove its optimality in a systematic and mathematically rigorous manner. ❧ To achieve the first goal, we have developed and thoroughly analyzed algorithms for hybrid message passing interface (MPI) + open multiprocessing (OpenMP) parallelization of n-tuple MD simulation, which are scalable on large multicore clusters. Two data-privatization thread scheduling algorithms via nucleation-growth allocation have been designed: (1) compact-volume allocation scheduling (CVAS); and (2) breadth-first allocation scheduling (BFAS). These two algorithms combine fine-grain dynamic load balancing and minimal memory-footprint threading. Theoretical study has revealed decent asymptotic memory efficiency for both algorithms, thereby reducing 75% memory consumption compared to a naïve-threading algorithm. Furthermore, performance benchmarks have confirmed higher performance of the hybrid MD algorithm over a traditional algorithm on large multicore clusters, where 2.58-fold speedup of the hybrid algorithm over the traditional algorithm was observed on 32,768 nodes of IBM BlueGene/P. ❧ We have also investigated the performance characteristics of HTM on the IBM BlueGene/Q computer in comparison with conventional concurrency control mechanisms, using an MD application as an example. Benchmark tests, along with overhead-cost and scalability analysis, have quantified relative performance advantages of HTM over other mechanisms. We found that the bookkeeping cost of HTM is high but that the rollback cost is low. We have proposed transaction fusion and spatially compact scheduling techniques to reduce the overhead of HTM with minimal programming. A strong scalability benchmark has shown that the fused HTM has the shortest runtime among various concurrency control mechanisms without extra memory. Based on the performance characterization, we have derived a decision tree in the concurrency-control design space for general multithreading applications. ❧ To achieve the second goal, we have developed a computation-pattern algebraic framework to mathematically formulate general n-tuple computation. Based on translation/reflection-invariant properties of computation patterns within this framework, we have designed a shift-collapse (SC) algorithm for cell-based parallel MD. Theoretical analysis has quantified the compact n-tuple search space and small communication cost of SC-MD for arbitrary n, which are reduced to those in best pair-computation approaches (e.g. eighth-shell method) for n = 2. Benchmark tests have shown that SC-MD outperforms our production MD code at the finest grain, with 9.7- and 5.1-fold speedups on Intel-Xeon and BlueGene/Q clusters. SC-MD has also exhibited excellent strong scalability. ❧ In addition, we have analyzed the computational and data-access patterns of MD, which led to the development of a performance prediction model for short-range pair-wise force computations in MD simulations. The analysis and performance model provide fundamental understanding of computation patterns and optimality of certain parameters in MD simulations, thus allowing scientists to determine the optimal cell dimension in a linked-list cell method. The model has accurately estimated the number of operations during the simulations with the maximum error of 10.6% compared to actual measurements. Analysis and benchmark of the model have revealed that the optimal cell dimension minimizing the computation time is determined by a trade-off between decreasing search space and increasing linked-list cell access for smaller cells. ❧ One difficulty about MD is that it is a dynamic irregular application, which often suffers considerable performance deterioration during execution. To address this problem, an optimal data-reordering schedule has been developed for runtime memory-access optimization of MD simulations on parallel computers. Analysis of the memory-access penalty during MD simulations has shown that the performance improvement from computation and data reordering degrades gradually as data translation lookaside buffer misses increase. We have also found correlations between the performance degradation with physical properties such as the simulated temperature, as well as with computational parameters such as the spatial-decomposition granularity. Based on a performance model and pre-profiling of data fragmentation behaviors, we have developed an optimal runtime data-reordering schedule, thereby archiving speedup of 1.35, 1.36 and 1.28, respectively, for MD simulations of silica at temperatures 300 K, 3,000 K and 6,000 K. ❧ The main contributions of this dissertation research are two-fold: Metascalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading parallel algorithmic framework on emerging multicore parallel clusters, and a novel computation-pattern algebraic framework to design scalable algorithm for general n-tuple computation and prove its optimality in a mathematically rigorous manner. We expect that the proposed hybrid algorithms and mathematical approaches will provide a generic framework to a broad range of applications on future extreme-scale computing platforms.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-309586,scientific computing|performance modeling|Computer Science|high performance computing|n-tuple computation|molecular dynamics|algorithm,,,,2013-01-01,usc.dl,Metascalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading algorithms for n-tuple computation,,

Here, we used phylogenetic inferences, species delineation methods and Bayesian phylogeographic diffusion models to test for the likelihood of postglacial colonization from distant refugia among five morphospecies of Proasellus (Isopoda, Asellidae).

Is the control of movement less stable when we walk or run in challenging settings? Intuitively, one might answer that it is, given that challenging locomotion externally (e.g. rough terrain) or internally (e.g. age-related impairments) makes our movements more unstable. Here, we investigated how young and old humans synergistically activate muscles during locomotion when different perturbation levels are introduced. Of these control signals, called muscle synergies, we analyzed the stability over time and the complexity (or irregularity). Surprisingly, we found that perturbations force the central nervous system to produce muscle activation patterns that are less unstable and less complex. These outcomes show that robust locomotion in challenging settings is achieved by producing less complex control signals which are more stable over time, whereas easier tasks allow for more unstable and irregular control.

How to use the data set

This supplementary data set contains: a) the metadata with anonymized participant information, b) the raw electromyographic (EMG) data acquired during locomotion, c) the touchdown and lift-off timings of the recorded limb, d) the filtered and time-normalized EMG, e) the muscle synergies extracted via non-negative matrix factorization and f) the code written in R (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) to process the data, including the scripts to calculate the short-term Maximum Lyapunov Exponents (sMLE) and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) of motor primitives. In total, 476 trials from 86 participants are included in the supplementary data set.

The file “participant_data.dat” is available in ASCII and RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format and contains:


	Code: the participant’s code
	Experiment: the experimental setup in which the participant was involved (E1 = walking and running, overground and treadmill; E2 = walking and running, even- and uneven-surface; E3 = unperturbed and perturbed walking, young and old)
	Group: the group to which the participant was assigned (see methods for the details)
	Sex: the participant’s sex (M or F)
	Speed: the speed at which the recordings were conducted in [m/s] (two values separated by a comma mean that recordings were done at two different speeds, i.e. walking and running)
	Age: the participant’s age in years (participants were considered old if older than 65 years, but younger than 80)
	Height: the participant’s height in [cm]
	Mass: the participant’s body mass in [kg].


The files containing the gait cycle breakdown are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the file named “CYCLE_TIMES.RData”. The files are structured as data frames with 30 rows (one for each gait cycle) and two columns. The first column contains the touchdown incremental times in seconds. The second column contains the duration of each stance phase in seconds. Each trial is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “CYCLE_TIMES_P0020,” where the characters “CYCLE_TIMES” indicate that the trial contains the gait cycle breakdown times and the characters “P0020” indicate the participant number (in this example the 20th). Please note that the overground trials of participants P0001 and P0009 and the second uneven-surface running trial of participant P0048 only contain 22, 27 and 23 cycles, respectively.

The files containing the raw, filtered and the normalized EMG data are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the files named “RAW_EMG.RData” and “FILT_EMG.RData”. The raw EMG files are structured as data frames with 30000 rows (one for each recorded data point) and 14 columns. The first column contains the incremental time in seconds. The remaining thirteen columns contain the raw EMG data, named with muscle abbreviations that follow those reported in the methods section. Each trial is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “RAW_EMG_P0053_OW_02”, where the characters “RAW_EMG” indicate that the trial contains raw emg data, the characters “P0053” indicate the participant number (in this example the 53rd), the characters “OW” indicate the locomotion type (E1: OW=overground walking, OR=overground running, TW=treadmill walking, TR=treadmill running; E2: EW=even-surface walking, ER=even-surface running, UW=uneven-surface walking, UR=uneven-surface running; E3: NW=normal walking, PW=perturbed walking), and the numbers “02” indicate the trial number (in this case the 2nd). The 10 trials per participant recorded for each overground session (i.e. 10 for walking and 10 for running) were concatenated into one. The filtered and time-normalized EMG data is named, following the same rules, like “FILT_EMG_P0053_OG_02”.

The files containing the muscle synergies extracted from the filtered and normalized EMG data are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the files named “SYNS_H.RData” and “SYNS_W.RData”. The muscle synergies files are divided in motor primitives and motor modules and are presented as direct output of the factorization and not in any functional order. Motor primitives are data frames with 6000 rows and a number of columns equal to the number of synergies (which might differ from trial to trial) plus one. The rows contain the time-dependent coefficients (motor primitives), one column for each synergy plus the time points (columns are named e.g. “Time, Syn1, Syn2, Syn3”, where “Syn” is the abbreviation for “synergy”). Each gait cycle contains 200 data points, 100 for the stance and 100 for the swing phase which, multiplied by the 30 recorded cycles, result in 6000 data points distributed in as many rows. This output is transposed as compared to the one discussed above to improve user readability. Each set of motor primitives is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “SYNS_H_P0012_PW_02”, where the characters “SYNS_H” indicate that the trial contains motor primitive data, the characters “P0012” indicate the participant number (in this example the 12th), ), the characters “PW” indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers “02” indicate the trial number (in this case the 2nd). Motor modules are data frames with 13 rows (number of recorded muscles) and a number of columns equal to the number of synergies (which might differ from trial to trial). The rows, named with muscle abbreviations that follow those reported in the methods section, contain the time-independent coefficients (motor modules), one for each synergy and for each muscle. Each set of motor modules relative to one synergy is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “SYNS_W_P0082_PW_02”, where the characters “SYNS_W” indicate that the trial contains motor module data, the characters “P0082” indicate the participant number (in this example the 82nd) ), the characters “PW” indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers “02” indicate the trial number (in this case the 2nd). Given the nature of the NMF algorithm for the extraction of muscle synergies, the supplementary data set might show non-significant differences as compared to the one used for obtaining the results of this paper.

The files containing the sMLE calculated from motor primitives are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the file named “sMLE.RData”. sMLE results are presented in a list of lists containing, for each trial, 1) the divergences, 2) the sMLE, and 3) the value of the R2 between the divergence curve and its linear interpolation made using the specified amount of points. The divergences are presented as a one-dimensional vector. sMLE are one number like the R2 value. Trials are named like “MLE_P0081_EW_01”, where the characters “sMLE” indicate that the trial containss sMLE data, the characters “P0081” indicate the participant number (in this example the 81st) ), the characters “EW” indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers “01” indicate the trial number (in this case the 1st).

The files containing the HFD calculated from motor primitives are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the file named “HFD.RData”. HFD results are presented in a list of lists containing, for each trial, 1) the HFD, and 2) the interval time k used for the calculations. HFDs are presented as one number, as are the interval times k. Trials are named like “HFD_P0048_TR_01”, where the characters “HFD” indicate that the trial contains HFD data, the characters “P0048” indicate the participant number (in this example the 48th), the characters “TR” indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers “01” indicate the trial number (in this case the 1st).

All the code used for the preprocessing of EMG data, the extraction of muscle synergies, the calculation of sMLE and HFD is available in R (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format. Explanatory comments are profusely present throughout the scripts (“SYNS.R”, which is the script to extract synergies, “fun_NMF.R”, which contains the NMF function, “sMLE.R”, which is the script to calculate the sMLE of motor primitives, “HFD.R”, which is the script to calculate the HFD of motor primitives, “fun_sMLE.R”, which contains the sMLE function and “fun_HFD.R”, which contains the HFD function).",10.5281/zenodo.3408736,muscle synergies|lyapunov|neuroscience|locomotion|fractal dimension,,muscle synergies|lyapunov|neuroscience|locomotion|fractal dimension,,2019-09-16,ZENODO,Neuromotor dynamics of human locomotion in challenging settings,article,

The second overtone spectrum at 10484 cm–1 is obtained by double resonance IR-UV resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy via the 3pz electronic state. The third overtone spectra of CH2OH and CD2OH are observed at ~13600 cm–1 by monitoring H-atom photofragments while scanning the excitation laser frequency. Dissociation via tunneling is proposed.

Here we focus on the long-term study describing metapopulation dynamics of an obligate pathogen, the powdery mildew (Podosphaera plantaginis) naturally infecting its wild host plant (Plantago lanceolata) in the fragmented landscape of the Åland archipelago (southwest Finland). Regionally, the pathogen persists through a balance of extinctions and colonizations, yet factors affecting extinction rates remain poorly understood. Mycoparasites of the genus Ampelomyces appear as good candidates for testing the role of a hyperparasite, i.e. a parasite of other parasites, in the regulation of their fungal hosts’ population dynamics. For this purpose, we first designed a quantitative PCR assay for detection of Ampelomyces spp. in field-collected samples. This newly developed molecular test was then applied to a large-scale sampling within the Åland archipelago, revealing that Ampelomyces is a widespread hyperparasite in this system, with high variability in prevalence among populations. We found that the hyperparasite was more common on leaves where multiple powdery mildew strains coexist, a pattern that may be attributed to differential exposure. Moreover, the prevalence of Ampelomyces at the plant level negatively affected the overwinter survival of its fungal host. We conclude that this hyperparasite may likely impact on its host population dynamics and argue for increased focus on the role of hyperparasites in disease dynamics.",10.5061/dryad.mv332,Metapopulation|Plant Pathogen|Disease|Hyperparasite|Molecular detection|Regulation,"Department of Plant Anatomy, Eötvös Loránd University, Pázmány Péter|Metapopulation Research Group, Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki|Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences, Stockholm University|Plant Protection Institute, Centre for Agricultural Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences",Ampelomyces|Podosphaera plantaginis,,2014-09-04,DRYAD,Data from: A hyperparasite affects the population dynamics of a wild plant pathogen,,

Our analysis of temporal genetic variation across 14 northern California tidewater goby populations failed to recover genetic change expected with extinction–colonization cycles. Similarly, analysis of site occupancy data from field studies (94 sites) indicated that extinction and colonization are very infrequent for our study populations. Comparison of the approaches indicated field data were subject to imperfect detection, and falsely implied extinction–colonization cycles in several instances. For northern California populations of tidewater goby, we interpret the strong genetic differentiation between populations and high degree of within-site temporal stability as consistent with a model of drift in the absence of migration, at least over the past 20–30 years. Our findings show that tidewater goby exhibit different population structures across their geographic range (extinction–colonization dynamics in the south vs. drift in isolation in the north). For northern populations, natural dispersal is too infrequent to be considered a viable approach for recolonizing extirpated populations, suggesting that species recovery will likely depend on artificial translocation in this region. More broadly, this work illustrates that temporal genetic analysis can be used in combination with field data to strengthen inference of extinction–colonization dynamics or as a stand-alone tool when field data are lacking.",10.5061/dryad.871db,microsatellites|conservation|extinction|colonization|metapopulation|tidewater goby,Humboldt State University|Landesfischereizentrum Vorarlberg|Department of Fisheries Biology|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology|Arcata Fish and Wildlife Office|University of California|Los Angeles,Eucyclogobius newberryi,,2015-10-15,DRYAD,Data from: Temporal genetic analysis of the endangered tidewater goby: metapopulation dynamics or drift in isolation?,,

This study used molecular methods to clarify the roles of commercial shipping and recreational boating in the invasion by the cosmopolitan tunicate, Botryllus schlosseri. We evaluated i) single vs. multiple introduction scenarios, ii) the relative importance of shipping and boating to primary introductions, iii) the interaction between these vectors for spread (i.e., the presence of a shipping-boating network), and iv) the role of boating in determining population similarity. Tunicates were sampled from 26 populations along the Nova Scotia, Canada, coast that were exposed to either shipping (i.e., ports), or boating (i.e., marinas) activities. A total of 874 individuals (~30 per population) from 5 ports and 21 marinas was collected and analyzed using both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and 10 nuclear microsatellite markers. The geographical location of multiple hotspot populations indicates that multiple invasions have occurred in Nova Scotia. A loss of genetic diversity from port to marina populations suggests a stronger influence of ships than recreational boats on primary coastal introductions. Population similarity analysis reveals a clear dependence of marina populations on those that had been previously established in ports and connectivity due to a boating network better explains patterns in population similarities than does natural spread.

,"El-Magboub, Asma Sadek",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-415454,DATASET,,"This work aims to address fundamental challenges in computational methodology used in the transition from drug discovery to drug development. The computational challenges include suboptimal predictions of solubility and rate of solution, which are important for prediction of pharmacokinetics; and neglect of solvation during prediction of binding (docking), which undermines the reliability of the outcomes. As an example, the work will focus on curcumin, a medicinally interesting molecule, but one that requires modification for practical use as a potential drug. The pharmacological effects of curcumin are a result of a synergism of networks of weak biochemical interactions with multiple biological targets in interrelated signaling pathways, which include: antiinflammatory, antioxidant, chemopreventive, anticancer, and antimicrobial effects. These effects have been examined in clinical trials that concluded that high doses of curcumin at the level of grams are required to obtain therapeutic effects. This is because the potential clinical efficacy of curcumin is limited by its physicochemical properties of poor water solubility and instability, which result in low bioavailability. Prodrugs of curcumin offer an approach to improvement of the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties, and may allow exploitation of the pharmacological effects of curcumin. The hypothesis in this work is that computational approaches can be used to understand and predict properties of curcumin and curcumin prodrugs that influence their oral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This will be assessed through building of models to (1) predict pharmacokinetic properties; and (2) predict affinity and properties of binding with consideration of water environment contributions in each binding event. These models and protocols are executed using in-house algorithms (WATGEN and NASDAC) and commercial programs (GastroPlus™, NAMD, Autodock Vina), with validation based on experimental data collected from literature. ❧ First the results showed that using our protocol and our new pharmacokinetics model of prodrugs we were able to reproduce experimental findings of the plasma concentration profile of curcumin, when administered either as curcumin or as a prodrug, curcumin diethyldisuccinate. By applying the same protocol and model to curcumin diglutaric acid we found that this prodrug releases curcumin in vivo with an estimated 25-folds increase in Cmax (&gt; 4.5 ng/ml), tmax 1.5 h and t1/2 2.5 h. These findings suggest that curcumin diglutaric acid improves the pharmacokinetic properties of curcumin. This work required evaluation of the predictions of solubility and rate of solution of many drugs and showed that these predictions are still suboptimal. Predictions based on 2D structural information may be insufficient in the drug discovery arena. ❧ Second, we predicted the affinity and binding properties of curcumin and curcumin diethyldisuccinate with B-DNA, with consideration of the contributions of water molecules in the binding interface. The results were compared to a positive control (netropsin). The results showed that the order of theoretical affinity was curcumin &lt; curcumin diethyldisuccinate &lt; netropsin, and only netropsin was able to displace all water molecules from the minor groove. Curcumin lacks this ability due to its planarity which minimize its isoheliciy with the minor groove. Curcumin diethyldisuccinate has the same structural feature of planarity of curcumin, which limits its ability to displace all water molecules from the minor groove. Thus, 3D conformations contribute to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of medicinal molecules such as curcumin. In solution, conformation is most relevant to biological activity since it controls recognition and selectivity components. Herein we used molecular dynamics to predict in solution conformers of curcumin and its derivatives. ❧ Lastly, the models developed for curcumin are likely to be extendable to other drug candidates. We used our protocols to expedite the drug discovery process of a series of new sesquiterpenes designed to target COX2 to improve sensitivity of tumor cells toward photodynamic therapy by inhibition of COX2 expression and activity. Our protocol aided in identification of a lead compound (number 9). In conclusion, computational methodology can be used to understand and predict properties that influence oral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medicinally interesting molecules.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-415454,Pharmaceutical Sciences|prediction of oral pharmacokinetics|prediction of affinity and binding properties|curcumin prodrugs|solubility|solvation of binding interfaces|curcumin,,,,2017-01-01,usc.dl,Computational models for drug design and delivery,,

Abstract 
Metadynamics is a highly successful enhanced sampling technique for simulation of molecular processes and prediction of their free energy surfaces. An in-depth analysis of data obtained by this method is as important as the simulation itself. Although there are several tools to compute free energy surfaces from metadynamics data, they usually lack user friendliness and a build-in visualization part. Here we introduce Metadyn View as a fast and user friendly viewer of bias potential/free energ...

Although experimental tests of theory from a range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding the influence of several driving processes, we know little as to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence of structures at larger scales, such as coevolutionary dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the structure of community interaction matrices, so called ‘bipartite networks’, reflected observed coevolutionary dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race coevolutionary dynamics and the other fluctuating coevolutionary dynamics. Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary time, but we found no evidence for a trade off with impact on bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor, while bacteria coevolving with the fluctuating selection phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions of the pilF gene associated with Type IV pili. We conclude that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is not necessarily specific to coevolutionary dynamics, and discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was, nevertheless, locally adapted.",10.5061/dryad.5dk27,Host Parasite Interactions|Experimental Evolution|Bacteria|Coevolution|Bacteriophage|Adaptation,Department of Zoology|Département de Sciences Biologiques|Université de Montréal|UMR5554|Université de Montpellier|University of Oxford|Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier|Santa Fe Institute,,,2017-01-17,DRYAD,Data from: Network structure and local adaptation in coevolving bacteria-phage interactions,,

To understand how microorganisms coordinate a dynamic response to changes in zinc availability at the molecular level, we evaluated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein at each of the known Zur-regulated genes in Escherichia coli. We solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and show that this metalloregulatory protein represses gene expression by a highly cooperative binding of two adjacent dimers to essentially encircle the core element of each of the Zur-regulated promoters. Cooperativity in these protein-DNA interactions requires a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49′ that connect otherwise independent dimers. Analysis of the protein-DNA interface led to the discovery of a new member of the Zur-regulon: pliG. We demonstrate this gene is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc responsive manner. The pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur regulon promoters. Comparison of the in vitro Zur-DNA binding affinity at each of four Zur-regulon promoters reveals ca. 10,000-fold variation Zur-DNA binding constants. The degree of Zur repression observed in vivo by comparison of transcript copy number in wild-type and Δzur strains parallels this trend spanning a 100-fold difference.

The fossil record has long been the only source of information on patterns of diversification, but the molecular record, derived from time-calibrated phylogenies, is becoming an important additional resource. Both fossil and molecular approaches have shortcomings and biases. These have been well studied for fossil data but much less so for molecular data and empirical comparisons between approaches are lacking. Here we compare the patterns of diversification derived from fossil and molecular data in scleractinian reef coral species. We also assess the robustness of molecular diversification rates to poor taxon sampling. We find that the temporal pattern of molecular diversification rates is robust to incomplete sampling when rates are calculated per interval. The major obstacle of molecular methods is that rate estimates are distorted because diversification rates can never be negative, whereas the fossil record suffers from incomplete preservation and inconsistent taxonomy. Nevertheless, the molecular pattern of diversification is comparable to the pattern we observe in the fossil record, with the timing of major diversification pulses coinciding in each dataset.

To determine the extent by which absolute TF concentration dictates gene expression and morphogenesis programs that ultimately lead to patterns in Drosophila embryos, we manipulate maternally supplied patterning determinants and measure readout concentration at the position of various developmental markers. When we increase the overall amount of the maternal TF Bicoid 5-fold, Bicoid concentrations in cells at positions of the cephalic furrow, an early morphological marker, differ by a factor of two. This finding apparently contradicts the traditional threshold-dependent readout model, which predicts that the Bicoid concentrations at these positions should be identical. In contrast, Bicoid concentration at target gene expression boundaries is nearly unchanged during early developmental times, but adjusts dynamically toward the same 2-fold change as development progresses. Thus the Drosophila segmentation gene network responds faithfully to Bicoid concentration during early development, in agreement with the threshold model, but subsequently partially adapts in response to altered Bicoid dosage, driving segmentation patterns towards their wild-type positions.

that catalyses the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter !-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
occurs as two isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67. GAD is found in the brain and substantial
amounts of GAD65 and GAD67 are also found in the !-islet cells of the pancreas, epithelial
cells of oviduct and spermatocytes in the testes. The 67 kDa isoform, GAD67, is
constitutively active and produces &gt;90% of GABA in the central nervous system, whereas
GAD65 is transiently activated to produce GABA in response to a sudden increase in demand.
According to their linear sequence, the first 100 amino acids in the two isoforms differ
substantially, but the isoforms show 74% sequence identity within the middle and the Cterminal
domain. The association and dissociation of PLP plays an important role in the
regulatory function of the GAD enzymes and GAD65 exists predominantly as an apoenzyme
(no PLP attached in the enzyme catalytic site), but GAD67 exists predominantly in its active
holoform. There are structural differences between the apo- and holo-forms of the enzyme.
Antibodies to GAD65 (anti-GAD65) occur frequently in type 1 diabetes (T1D) but GAD67
is rarely autoantigenic in T1D and these antibodies (anti-GAD67) may represent a cross
reactive population of anti-GAD65. The recently elucidated crystal structures of GAD65 and
GAD67, N-terminally truncated by 87 (GAD65) or 92 (GAD67) amino acids revealed
flexible disordered regions at the C termini on GAD65 but not in GAD67, and B-cell epitopes
for various human monoclonal antibodies (hmAb) are located on the flexible regions of
GAD65.
The hypothesis for this work is that differences in the two isoforms in structural
flexibility, or structural changes resulting from interaction with the PLP co-factor
provide the basis for the difference in autoantigenicity of the GAD isoforms.
Based on the hypothesis the project is designed to have three different aims;
1. To confirm that GAD65 is the major autoantigen in T1D, and that anti-GAD67
represents a cross-reactive subset of anti-GAD65.
2. To design mutants of GAD65 to stabilize the C-terminal domain of GAD65, and to
compare their reactivity with T1D sera with that of wild type GAD65.
3. To use computational modelling and computational docking to compare the
reactivities of the hMabs b96.11 and b78 with apo- and holo-GAD.
The levels, frequency, affinity and nature of cross reactivity of anti-GAD67 in sera from
patients with T1D or LADA, that contained anti-GAD65 were measured by
radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) using 125I-labeled recombinant GAD65 and GAD67. For
each antibody population, the specificity of the binding was measured by incubation with
100-fold excess of unlabeled GAD in homologous and heterologous inhibition assays, and the
affinity of binding with GAD65 and GAD67 was measured in selected sera. Sera were also
tested for reactivity to GAD65 and GAD67 by immunoblotting. Of the 85 sera that contained
anti-GAD65, 28 contained anti–GAD67 measured by RIP. Inhibition with unlabeled GAD65
substantially or completely reduced antibody reactivity with both 125I GAD65 and with 125I
GAD67. In contrast, unlabeled GAD67 reduced autoantibody reactivity with 125I GAD67 but
not with 125I GAD65. Both populations of antibodies were of high affinity. Immunoblotting
experiment indicated that the epitopes for anti-GAD67 are conformational, like that of anti-
GAD65. Competitive inhibition assay results suggest that for most sera anti-GAD67
represents a minor population of anti-GAD65 reactive with an epitope shared between
GAD65 and GAD67. So our findings lead to the conclusion that the anti-GAD67 represents
a cross reactive population of anti-GAD65.
The effect of flexibility on the autoantigenicity of holo-GAD65 was tested using a
combination of molecular dynamic simulation and mutagenesis techniques. Mutants were
designed based on molecular dynamic simulations performed on the wild type GAD isoforms
GAD65 and GAD67. These simulations predicted a flexible α–helix 14 on GAD65 in the Cterminal
domain. Potential amino acid residues in and around the α–helix 14 which could be
the main cause for the flexibility were identified. Two single mutants (GAD65H432A and
GAD65P531A) and two double mutants in which the C-terminus was stabilized by disulphide
bonds (GAD65H432C_P531C and GAD65I509C_V529C), were tested for structural and functional
stability by CD spectroscopy and GAD enzyme assay, and tested for reactivity with anti-
GAD65 in sera by RIP. All the four mutants of GAD65 along with the wild type GAD65 and
GAD67 were tested for conformational changes and thermal stability using circular dichroism
on a Jasco J-815 spectrometer equipped with a Jasco Petlier type temperature controller
(JASCO CDF-426S/15). The mutants GAD65H432A, GAD65H432C_P531C and GAD65I509C_V529C
were expressed and purified similarly to WT-GAD65 and showed similar conformations to
WT-GAD65. The mutants retained the same fold and secondary structure composition as that for the native WT GAD65 with the expected increased conformational stability, measured as
increased thermal melting temperatures (Tm) on CD spectroscopy, and enzyme activity
measurements showed that each retained some activity under the reducing conditions of the
assay. Nonetheless, anti-GAD65 reactivity by RIP with each of the mutants was substantially
or completely lost. The fourth mutant GAD65P531A expressed poorly, lacked enzymatic
activity and reactivity by RIP, and was thought to be miss-folded. Taken together these
results indicate that C-terminal flexibility is an important component of the antigenicity of
GAD65.
The flexibility of GAD65 could include changes in structure between holo- and apo-
GAD65, and the recent publication of a crystal structure for the apo- form of the related PLPdependent
decarboxylase, dopa-decarboxylase, DDC, has provided the opportunity to develop
an homology model for apo-GAD65. To determine whether structural changes during
binding of PLP are likely to affect antigenicity computational docking was used to compare
the reactivity of human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) b78 and b96.11 with holo- and apo-
GAD65. Homology models of Fv b78 and Fv b96.11 were docked to structures of holo-
GAD65 and modelled apo-GAD65 using the rigid-body docking program ZDOCK, followed
by refinement with RDOCK. The 30 most favourable complexes from RDOCK and 10 most
favourable from ZDOCK were further analysed based on previously published mutagenesis
data and antibody CDR interactions. For comparison, the reactivity of the two mAbs and sera
from 14 patients with diabetes were also tested by RIP with GAD65 in the presence of PLP
(holo-GAD65), or 5mM glutamate (apo-GAD65). For each mAb, b78 and b96.11, docking
predicted epitope locations on both holo-GAD65 and apo-GAD65, but there were differences.
For b78, on holo-GAD65 the most favourable epitope region predicted included C-terminal and catalytic loop residues, consistent with its enzyme inhibitory nature. On apo-GAD65, the
most favourable complexes involved interactions of three or four acidic C-terminal residues
with basic residues in CDR L1 and CDR L2. More extensive interactions were rare, but were
similar to those on holo-GAD65, suggesting that two-stage antibody docking could occur
with apo-GAD65, initially involving a few strong interactions, followed by more complex
interactions occurring with main chain movements and induced fit. For b96.11, interactions
were similar with both holo- and apo-GAD65 and involved docking a hydrophobic knob
within a pocket on GAD65. RIP results showed that anti-GAD65 reactivity of diabetes sera,
or of the mAbs b78 and b96.11, is not affected by the presence or absence of co-factor PLP in
the active site of GAD65.
These results provide strong evidence that GAD65 is the autoantigenic isoform in T1D, and
that anti-GAD67 results from the presence of a minor population of cross-reactive
autoantibodies. The structural basis for the antigenicity of GAD65 can be related to
flexibility in the C-terminal domain and the adjacent catalytic loop that is associated with the
autoinactivation of GAD65 and formation of apo-GAD65 during enzymatic activity.
Nonetheless, the formation of apo-GAD65 does not apparently alter the antigenicity of
GAD65, and it is likely that the flexibility in the C-terminal domain is retained in the apo-
GAD. Flexibility of antigen and/or antibody is frequently required for strong antibody
binding, and this study suggests that it plays a major part in the development of an
autoimmune response to GAD65 in T1D. It is notable that many autoantigens in autoimmune
diseases are enzymes, and that autoantibodies to these enzymes are frequently strongly
enzyme inhibitory, and bind within the catalytic domain, a region in an enzyme which is
likely to be the most mobile. A requirement for flexibility and mobility for antigenicity could
explain the development of such autoimmune responses.",10.4225/03/58b3a56a8d844,Uncategorized,,,,2017-01-01,ands.centre-3,Insights into autoimmunity: structural basis of autoantigenicity of GAD,,

This study employed molecular markers to study a large colony (n=56) of African Penguin hosted in an Italian biopark. A panel of 15 STRs (single tandem repeats) was selected, and genotype data were analyzed using COLONY software to determine parentage relationships and compare the existing studbook information to a pedigree built from genetic analyses. The existence of extra-pair mating and the presence of hybrids were investigated: discrepancies in kinship relationships emerged following molecular parentage analysis and ten unknown genetic relationships were revealed. Infidelity of one member of the pair was observed in six cases and extra-pair copulation was assessed by genetic analysis in two episodes. One member of the colony was found to be a hybrid (S. demersus X S. humboldti); his progeny, derived by extra-pair copulation, was traced. Three other hidden hybrids were discovered and assessed using the identified candidate private alleles. Overall, our results demonstrate that molecular methods to confirm parentage and analyze relatedness among colony members are a valuable tool to complement studbook-based genetic management of African penguin captive populations. Because a variety of behavioral dynamics (e.g., extra-pair mating) can make observations ineffective in some species and because molecular markers outperform studbook in identifying the presence of hybrids, reliance  on studbook information alone is not recommended.",10.5061/dryad.9cv7kg7,pedigree|COLONY software|STRs|Reproductive strategies and kinship analysis|Conservation genetics and biodiversity|extra-pair mating|hybrids|Zoo,,Spheniscus demersus,,2018-07-06,DRYAD,Data from: Molecular genetics unveiled unknown family relationships and hybrids in an ex-situ colony of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus),,

This question has gone understudied given the limited resolution of past molecular markers for studying such dynamic phenomena. With an average of 32000 SNPs from the genome of 136 individuals from ten populations of a Caribbean flightless ground cricket species (Amphiacusta sanctaecrucis) and a complementary set of statistical approaches, we infer a stepping-stone colonization model and high levels of genetic differentiation across the Virgin Islands, which have been periodically inter-connected until 8 ka. Estimates of divergence times from models based on the site frequency spectrum coincide with a period of repeated connection and fragmentation of the islands at 75–130 ka. These results are consistent with a role of island connectivity cycles in promoting genomic divergence and indicate that the genetic distinctiveness of island populations has persisted despite subsequent and extended interisland connections identified from bathymetric data. We discuss these findings in the broader context of Caribbean biogeography, and more specifically why high levels of genomic divergence across the Virgin Islands associated with repeated connectivity cycles do not actually translate into species diversification.",10.5061/dryad.23hs1,Genetic Variation|Gene Flow|Phylogeography|Biogeography|Population Structure,"Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan",Amphiacusta sanctaecrucis,,2015-04-20,DRYAD,Data from: Genomic tests of the species-pump hypothesis: recent island connectivity cycles drive population divergence but not speciation in Caribbean crickets across the Virgin Islands,,

Moreover, we have reported that many of these are in a SUMO-conjugated form when bound to a pre-mRNA substrate during a splicing reaction. We demonstrated that SUMOylation of Prp3 (PRPF3), a component of the U4/U6 di-snRNP, is required for U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP formation and/or recruitment to active spliceosomes. Expanding upon our previous results, we have shown that the splicing factor SRSF1 stimulates SUMO conjugation to several spliceosomal proteins. Given the relevance of the splicing process, as well as the complex and dynamic nature of its governing machinery, the spliceosome, the molecular mechanisms that modulate its function represent an attractive topic of research. We posit that SUMO conjugation could represent a way of modulating spliceosome assembly and thus, splicing efficiency. How cycles of SUMOylation/de-SUMOylation of spliceosomal proteins become integrated throughout the highly choreographed spliceosomal cycle awaits further investigation.",10.6084/m9.figshare.6236549.v1,Molecular Biology|Genetics|39999 Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified|69999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified|Biochemistry|Biophysics|Developmental Biology|Cancer,,,,2018-01-01,figshare.ars,When SUMO met splicing,,

However different parts of the chicken body have different size feathers. How stem cells are managed differently in these different feathers has not been elucidated. Here we analyze the growth pattern of feathers from neck and saddle feather. We analyze the topological arrangement of stem cell, TA cell, differentiated cell during different regenerative feather cycling. We found the stem cell is in a ring configuration during growth phase but shifted down to smaller ring or to assume a Ushape flanking the dermal papilla. The number of stem cells remains rather constant during stem cell cycling but also changes around three folds. On the contrast the number of TA cells change up to twenty thirty fold differences. There also appear to have higher stem cell number and a larger dermal papilla in the saddle compared to the neck feather. We found N-CAM and Tenascin-C expressed in the niche next to the stem cells. We also found TGF-beta2 enriched in the stem cells in the resting phase of the dermal papilla. This work suggests there is a dramatic shifting of stem cell topology during feather cycling, probably to accommodate the different homeotic relationship between stem, TA and differentiated cells. The dynamic changes of molecules also refract the dynamic changes of the microenvironment in the stem cell niche. Further investigation would be required to understand their molecular mechanism and regulation.",10.25549/usctheses-m1902,stem cells|Experimental &amp; Molecular Pathology|transient amplifying cells|differentiated cells,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Shifting topology of stem cells and molecular expression during feather regenerative cycling,,

Description:


Speed discrimination


In the speed discrimination task, the subject was presented with a standard stimulus and a comparison stimulus (each 2 s long with a break of 500 ms in between). The standard stimulus was always presented first at a speed of either 3, 5 or 7 arbitrary units (AU)/s. The comparison stimulus was chosen from a range of +- 2 AU/s around the speed of the standard stimulus. After both stimuli had been presented, subjects had to indicate which one was perceived as faster by pressing one of two buttons. The combination of three standard speeds and two modality conditions resulted in 6 experimental conditions. In each condition 41 trials were performed that covered the given range of +- 2 AU/s in equidistant steps of 0.1 AU/s. In this discrimination task, each experimental condition was presented only once. The trials were conducted in a pseudo-randomized order.


Distance reproduction


In the first experiment, we tested the ability of the subjects to reproduce a previously passively observed traveled distance using visual, tactile or bi-modal feedback. The subject was presented with a simulation of self-motion over a certain distance. The speeds during this presentation were always constant at 4 or 7 AU/s and the distances were either 5, 10 or 15 AU. In this first phase the stimulation was always bi-modal. After this presentation and a brief pause of 500 ms the task of the subject was to reproduce the passively observed distance using a joystick. In this second part either only the visual information, only the tactile information, or both modalities were available. The order of all conditions was pseudo-random.


Re-scaling of tactile information


In the second experiment we investigated the effect of re-scaling of tactile information on the reproduced traveled distance. All simulated self-motion was bi-modal. The subjects were passively observing a simulated self-motion over a certain distance. The speed of this motion was not constant but had a sinusoidal profile with a peak speed at either 5 or 7 AU/s. The traveled distances were either 10, 15 or 20 AU. After the first presented distance and a brief gap of 500 ms another distance was presented passively. The speed profile of this second movement consisted of three different speeds between 3 AU/s and 10 AU/s. The distance covered by this second passive movement was always one third of the first passive distance but the subjects were neither informed about nor aware of this relationship. After the second presentation had stopped, the task of the subjects was to actively reproduce the first observed distance as a sum of the second passively observed distance and the subsequent active motion. In random 10% of the trials the tactile component of the motion was scaled up by 25% and in another 10% of the trials it was down-scaled by 25%. This means that the speed of the air flow on these trials was 25% faster (or slower) than in the rest of the trials. The re-scaling was applied only during the second passive motion and the active reproduction part of each trial. The subjects were not informed about and were not aware of this manipulation.


The experiments on distance reproduction and tactile rescaling were performed in two variations that differed in the relationship between the speed of the tactile stimulus and the speed of self-motion. While in the congruent condition the speed of the air flow was directly proportional to the speed of visual self-motion, in the incongruent condition the relation of the two measures was inversely proportional. The congruent and the incongruent configurations were always used in both, the presentation as well as in the reproduction phase of a trial. Importantly, a purely visual stimulation used in the two conditions was identical in both cases. The subjects were informed that in the incongruent experiments slow speed of air flow indicates a fast speed of self-motion. To avoid any confusion, separate groups of subjects were tested in the congruent and in the incongruent conditions.

The FPR model is based on a coupled system of Fokker–Planck equations wherein the distribution of each island type is governed by its own Fokker–Planck equation for growth, with reaction terms describing the shape transitions between islands of different types including asymmetric shapes. The reaction terms for the shape transitions depend on the island size and are determined from explicit calculations of the lowest barrier pathway for each shape transition. This mean-field model enables us to consider the kinetics of asymmetric shape transitions and study the evolution of island shape distributions during the coupled growth and transition process. Asymmetric metastable shapes play a crucial role in the dynamics, with asymmetric QDs comprising up to 10% of the population, and with up to 100% of the shape transitions passing through asymmetric shapes.

Here we analyze the growth pattern of feathers from neck and saddle feather. We analyze the topological arrangement of stem cell, TA cell, differentiated cell during different regenerative feather cycling. We found the stem cell is in a ring configuration during growth phase but shifted down to smaller ring or to assume a Ushape flanking the dermal papilla. The number of stem cells remains rather constant during stem cell cycling but also changes around three folds. On the contrast the number of TA cells change up to twenty thirty fold differences. There also appear to have higher stem cell number and a larger dermal papilla in the saddle compared to the neck feather. We found N-CAM and Tenascin-C expressed in the niche next to the stem cells. We also found TGF-beta2 enriched in the stem cells in the resting phase of the dermal papilla. This work suggests there is a dramatic shifting of stem cell topology during feather cycling, probably to accommodate the different homeotic relationship between stem, TA and differentiated cells.

Gathering dietary data from predatory species, such as insectivorous bats, often presents logistical challenges, further exacerbated in biodiversity hot spots because prey items are highly speciose, yet their taxonomy is largely undescribed. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and bioinformatic analyses to phylogenetically group DNA sequences into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) to examine predator–prey dynamics of three sympatric insectivorous bat species in the biodiversity hotspot of south-western Australia. We could only assign between 4% and 20% of MOTUs to known genera or species, depending on the method used, underscoring the importance of examining dietary diversity irrespective of taxonomic knowledge in areas lacking a comprehensive genetic reference database. MOTU analysis confirmed that resource partitioning occurred, with dietary divergence positively related to the ecomorphological divergence of the three bat species. We predicted that bat species' diets would converge during times of high energetic requirements, that is, the maternity season for females and the mating season for males. There was an interactive effect of season on female, but not male, bat species' diets, although small sample sizes may have limited our findings. Contrary to our predictions, females of two ecomorphologically similar species showed dietary convergence during the mating season rather than the maternity season.

While recent technological advancements have deepened our understanding of metabolic and evolutionary features of the symbiont genomes, molecular mechanisms underpinning the intimate interactions remain difficult to approach because the insect symbionts are generally uncultivable. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris is associated with the betaproteobacterial Burkholderia symbiont in a posterior region of the midgut, which develops numerous crypts harbouring the symbiont extracellularly. Distinct from other insect symbiotic systems, R. pedestris acquires the Burkholderia symbiont not by vertical transmission but from the environment every generation. By making use of the cultivability and the genetic tractability of the symbiont, we constructed a transgenic Burkholderia strain labelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which enabled detailed observation of spatiotemporal dynamics and the colonization process of the symbiont in freshly prepared specimens. The symbiont live imaging revealed that, at the second instar, colonization of the symbiotic midgut M4 region started around 6 h after inoculation (hai). By 24 hai, the symbiont cells appeared in the main tract and also in several crypts of the M4. By 48 hai, most of the crypts were colonized by the symbiont cells. By 72 hai, all the crypts were filled up with the symbiont cells and the symbiont localization pattern continued during the subsequent nymphal development. Quantitative PCR of the symbiont confirmed the infection dynamics quantitatively.

Being dependent on finding a host plant for growth, parasitic plants penetrate their host using specialized organs called haustoria. Haustoria establish vascular connections with the host, which enable the parasite to steal nutrients and water. The underlying molecular and developmental basis of parasitism by plants is largely unknown. In order to investigate the process of parasitism, RNAs from different stages, i.e. seed, seedling, vegetative strand, prehaustoria, haustoria, and flowers, were used to de-novo assemble and annotate the transcriptome of the obligate plant stem parasite Cuscuta pentagona (dodder). The assembled transcriptome was used to dissect transcriptional dynamics during dodder development and parasitism, and identified key gene categories involved in the process of plant parasitism. Host plant infection is accompanied with increased expression of parasite genes underlying transport and transporter categories, response to stress and stimuli, as well as genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall modifications. By contrast expression of photosynthetic genes is decreased in the dodder infective stages compared to normal stem. In addition, genes relating to biosynthesis, transport and response of phytohormones, such as auxin, gibberellins and strigolactone, were differentially expressed in the dodder infective stages compared to stem and seedlings.

The regions determining sexual identity are particularly dynamic parts of eukaryotic genomes that are prone to molecular degeneration associated with suppressed recombination. In the fungus Neurospora tetrasperma, it has been proposed that this molecular degeneration is counteracted by the introgression of non-degenerated DNA from closely related species. In this study, we used comparative and population genomic analyses of variation among 92 genomes from eight phylogenetically and reproductively isolated lineages of N. tetrasperma, and its three closest relatives, to investigate the factors shaping the evolutionary history of the genomes. We found that suppressed recombination extends across at least 6 Mbp (~63%) of the mating-type (mat) chromosome in N. tetrasperma, and is associated with decreased genetic diversity, which is likely the result primarily of selection at linked sites. Furthermore, analyses of molecular evolution revealed an increased mutational load in this region, relative to recombining regions. However, comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the mat chromosomes are temporarily regenerated via introgression from sister species; six out of eight lineages show introgression into one of their mat chromosomes, with at least three other Neurospora species acting as donors. The introgressed tracts have been driven to fixation in lineages, suggesting that they confer an adaptive advantage in natural populations, and our analyses support the presence of selective sweeps in at least one of the lineages. Thus, these data strongly support the previously hypothesized role of introgression as a mechanism for the maintenance of mating-type determining chromosomal regions.",10.5061/dryad.162mh,Recombination|Selection|Introgression,Department of Animal and Plant Sciences|Science for Life Laboratory|Uppsala University|BGI|Department of Ecology and Genetics|University of Sheffield|Department of Cell and Molecular Biology|Department of Organismal Biology,Neurospora tetrasperma|Neurospora,,2016-02-17,DRYAD,Data from: Introgression maintains the genetic integrity of the sex-determining chromosome of the fungus Neurospora tetrasperma,,

The interviews we conducted for the accompanying research suggest that several types of collaborations are not represented in the publication dataset, including unsuccessful collaborations, many types of student-driven practicum-style work, and for-hire work that may assist in regulatory filings, internal documents, or other non-academic publications.

We include four separate versions of this dataset at different stages of its refinement to better enable any reproductions, expansions or refinements of the dataset.

The first file (Initial Publication Queries By Utility.zip) is our raw output from the Scopus queries.

The second file (Author-Parsed Publication Queries By Utilities.zip) is the parsed output of the queries, where each author and affiliation are separated.

The third file (Publication Dataset with Duplicates and Erroneous Entries.csv) combines all utilities into a single file and includes many manual corrections to parsed or missing information, as well as some additional fields to classify data and identify duplicates and records erroneously included.

The fourth file (Final Utility-University Publication Dataset.csv) then removes some of those additional fields as well as all duplicates and erroneously included records. This was the file we used for our final analyses.",10.17632/87y67tnxtf.1,Collaborative Activity|Electricity|Collaboration Management|Collaborative Research|Electric Utility|Utility Industry|Collaborative Engineering|Academia|Energy Policy|Collaboration Strategy,University of Minnesota Institute on the Environment,Collaborative Activity|Electricity|Collaboration Management|Collaborative Research|Electric Utility|Utility Industry|Collaborative Engineering|Academia|Energy Policy|Collaboration Strategy,"To generate evidence of University/Utility (U/U) collaboration, we search the Scopus database for articles published that include at least one author affiliated with a large U.S. utility. We select the 20 largest utilities– in terms of revenue– from EIA's “2016 Utility Bundled Retail Sales - Total” data. We exclude several utilities listed in the EIA data but not in the list of Scopus affiliations (Puget Sound Energy Inc, Long Island Power Authority, and Reliant Energy Retail Services) and combined several utilities that are listed separately in the EIA data but are owned by larger holding companies (e.g. Duke Energy) or have merged (e.g. Public Service Company Colorado and Northern States Power Company). Those that remained were:

We did not go out of our way to include independent system operators in our searches, though when they showed up within queries, we classified them as if they were a utility. There were very few instances of this.

We then filter the Scopus query results to include only publications that include authors with “University”, “College”, “School” or “Institute” affiliations. The metadata was then downloaded as series of descriptive strings. Scripts were written to parse the strings as best as we were able into separate rows for each author and columns for name, affiliation, location, etc. 

A substantial amount of manual effort was then put in to verify these parsed strings, including verifying organizational affiliations (since dual affiliations were often listed where students had graduated between research and publication), verifying locations, classifying organizations, mapping distances (in retrospect, we recommend using a Google Distance API), identifying erroneously included publications (after dual-affiliations had been corrected) and duplicate publications (which were often similarly named conference presentations), and in some cases, standardizing author names across different naming conventions.",2019-02-13,MENDELEY_DATA,Utility-University Collaboration Publication Data,article,1

Gathering dietary data from predatory species, such as insectivorous bats, often presents logistical challenges, further exacerbated in biodiversity hot spots because prey items are highly speciose, yet their taxonomy is largely undescribed. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and bioinformatic analyses to phylogenetically group DNA sequences into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) to examine predator–prey dynamics of three sympatric insectivorous bat species in the biodiversity hotspot of south-western Australia. We could only assign between 4% and 20% of MOTUs to known genera or species, depending on the method used, underscoring the importance of examining dietary diversity irrespective of taxonomic knowledge in areas lacking a comprehensive genetic reference database. MOTU analysis confirmed that resource partitioning occurred, with dietary divergence positively related to the ecomorphological divergence of the three bat species. We predicted that bat species' diets would converge during times of high energetic requirements, that is, the maternity season for females and the mating season for males. There was an interactive effect of season on female, but not male, bat species' diets, although small sample sizes may have limited our findings. Contrary to our predictions, females of two ecomorphologically similar species showed dietary convergence during the mating season rather than the maternity season. HTS-based approaches can help elucidate complex predator–prey relationships in highly speciose regions, which should facilitate the conservation of biodiversity in genetically uncharacterized areas, such as biodiversity hotspots.",10.5061/dryad.km6ph,Environmental DNA|Predator Prey Interactions|Diet Analysis|Conservation Biology|Ecological Genetics|Wildlife Management,"School of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia|Alcoa of Australia Ltd.|Australian Wildlife Forensic Services and Ancient DNA Laboratory, School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University|School of Veterinary and Life Sciences, Murdoch University",Nyctophilus gouldi|Vespadelus regulus|Chalinolobus gouldii,,2013-09-18,DRYAD,Data from: Who’s for dinner?

While recent technological advancements have deepened our understanding of metabolic and evolutionary features of the symbiont genomes, molecular mechanisms underpinning the intimate interactions remain difficult to approach because the insect symbionts are generally uncultivable. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris is associated with the betaproteobacterial Burkholderia symbiont in a posterior region of the midgut, which develops numerous crypts harbouring the symbiont extracellularly. Distinct from other insect symbiotic systems, R. pedestris acquires the Burkholderia symbiont not by vertical transmission but from the environment every generation. By making use of the cultivability and the genetic tractability of the symbiont, we constructed a transgenic Burkholderia strain labelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which enabled detailed observation of spatiotemporal dynamics and the colonization process of the symbiont in freshly prepared specimens. The symbiont live imaging revealed that, at the second instar, colonization of the symbiotic midgut M4 region started around 6 h after inoculation (hai). By 24 hai, the symbiont cells appeared in the main tract and also in several crypts of the M4. By 48 hai, most of the crypts were colonized by the symbiont cells. By 72 hai, all the crypts were filled up with the symbiont cells and the symbiont localization pattern continued during the subsequent nymphal development. Quantitative PCR of the symbiont confirmed the infection dynamics quantitatively.

The assembled transcriptome was used to dissect transcriptional dynamics during dodder development and parasitism, and identified key gene categories involved in the process of plant parasitism. Host plant infection is accompanied with increased expression of parasite genes underlying transport and transporter categories, response to stress and stimuli, as well as genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall modifications.

Aiming to examine the current state of pathogen populations located in the Colombian Eastern Plains, we also used AFLP markers and we evaluated the usefulness of Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) as  new molecular markers for the study of Xam populations. Results: The population analyses showed that AFLP and VNTR provide a detailed and congruent description of Xam populations from the Colombian Eastern Plains. These two typing  strategies clearly separated strains from the Colombian Eastern Plains into distinct  populations probably because of geographical distance. Although the majority of analyses were congruent between typing markers, fewer VNTRs were needed to detect a higher number of genetic populations of the pathogen as well as a higher genetic flow among sampled locations than those detected by AFLPs.

In these simulations, the balance between reaction and molecular mixing plays a key role. To model molecular mixing, using a full multicomponent approach leads to high accuracy at the expense of a hefty computational cost. Thus, the use of a mixture-averaged model is usually preferred. Hence, this paper presents and tests a new OpenFOAM®-based code that incorporates a detailed, mixture-averaged approach for calculating transport properties in reacting flows, and provides a capability to solve either fully-compressible or low-Mach-number governing equations. The code is made readily available on GitHub and is written completely in OpenFOAM®’s native code framework, making it highly portable and easy to maintain, enhance, and extend. It is tested by modeling two laminar flames, and two turbulent flames undergoing extinction and reignition. Overall, predictions with the present code are seen to be in good agreement with experimental and direct-numerical-simulation data.",10.17632/h8hch3hs9p.1,Computational Physics,,Computational Physics,,2018-12-13,MENDELEY_DATA,Flame simulations with an open-source code,article,1

Here, we describe that dynamic acetylation of PCK1 interconverts the enzyme between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic activities. Under high glucose, p300-dependent hyperacetylation of PCK1 did not lead to protein degradation but instead increased the ability of PCK1 to perform the anaplerotic reaction, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. Lys91 acetylation destabilizes the active site of PCK1 and favors the reverse reaction. At low energy input, we demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates PCK1 and fully restores the gluconeogenic ability of PCK1. Additionally, we found that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PCK1 decreases acetylation and increases ubiquitination. Biochemical evidence suggests that serine phosphorylation adjacent to Lys91 stimulates SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of PCK1. This work reveals an unexpected capacity of hyperacetylated PCK1 to promote anaplerotic activity, and the intersection of post-translational control of PCK1 involving acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination.

,"Chiu, Cathleen Tsz Ka",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-589786,DATASET,,"11/20/2016 The proper construction of an organ is crucial for its function. To attain the desired physical architecture, the interactions of a cell with neighboring cells, the extracellular environment, and the soluble local and systemic cues held within that environment must be perfectly choreographed. The presented studies sought to explore these important biological features in the context of organogenesis. While this topic has been explored in other organ models, the feather bud offers a unique advantage in its complex architecture and representation of a multitude of cellular events embodied in a surgically and chemically manipulatable organ. Though research in the feather field has amassed a wealth of information pertaining to molecular signaling and stem cell biology, the dynamics of the ECM environment and the possible involvement of PCP signaling are not well-understood. ❧ Examination of the Laminin matrix during feather organogenesis revealed a dynamic environment in which the matrix is organized and reorganized in response to the environmental needs of the developing feather organ. Identification of an important MMP14 activity in the degradation of the Laminin matrix at the site of feather bud formation revealed a previously unknown step in feather organogenesis. This opens an avenue for further experimentation to better understand how the microenvironment may be manipulated for the purposes of tissue engineering. The observed cellular dynamics identified a local region of directed cellular movement that may be an important part of feather bud development. In addition, the heterogeneous composition of the Laminin matrix suggests the localization of the various Laminin types in different regions of the feather bud basement membrane may correspond with differential cell-ECM interactions. Further studies to identify specific cell-surface receptors, their binding partners, and their differential localization will help to elucidate the particular interactions or signaling modules that facilitate the different cellular events involved in feather bud development. ❧ The Collagen III matrix provides another example of an extremely dynamic environment. The dramatic changes observed during feather bud development and their coincidence with regional differences (e.g. bud vs. interbud and proximal vs. distal feather bud) and developmental stages (e.g. achieving competency in the feather field, progression from a symmetric to asymmetric organ, and development of secondary barb ridge structures) supports the importance of the ECM environment during organogenesis. The size of the developing feather bud makes it particularly valuable for visualizing the organization of the matrix in its entirety within one organ unit, a particularly difficult task in many organ models. Further studies to identify the MMP responsible for remodeling the Collagen III matrix will be invaluable to understanding the regulation of its dynamics. The identification of cell surface receptors and their regional localization will be important in understanding how cells in the feather bud are differentially interacting with the Collagen III environment and what role those interactions play in the branching morphogenesis. ❧ Lastly, while PCP signaling has been found to be involved in chondrogenesis in the avian model, a role had not been previously established in feather bud development. The stringently aligned structure of the developing barb ridge and the loss of proper axial and marginal plate alignment following Stbm overexpression strongly suggests a possible role for Stbm in maintaining the cellular polarity. Further studies will be needed to determine whether Stbm and SHH have the same mutually-regulating relationship in branching morphogenesis as was found in neural tube development and address whether Stbm-SHH is responsible for modifying the architectural spacing of barb ridges. The perturbation of the overall embryonic feather follicle shape following overexpression of Fz-7, likewise, requires more examination to determine the mechanism by which it is exerting its effect on peridermal convergent extension. Furthermore, it will be important to identify the Fz-7-binding Wnt ligand to distinguish the molecular signaling pathway involved in regulating feather follicle curvature. ❧ Exploration of biological architectural design and how that is manifested through biophysical and biochemical properties characteristic of various aspects of organogenesis is valuable for furthering the field of tissue engineering. The presented studies explore cellular dynamics, extracellular environment, and molecular signaling and demonstrate that the feather bud model can be a powerful tool that can lend itself to developing strategies for regenerative medicine.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-589786,feather|collagen|fluorescence resonance energy transfer|cellular dynamics|organogenesis|Prinomastat|MMP|Tranilast|Pathobiology|fibronectin|organ morphogenesis|matrix metalloproteinase|laminin|FRET|ARP-100|extracellular matrix,,,,2016-01-01,usc.dl,The shaping of feather development,,

The programs can be used to generate vortex lattices and study dynamics of rotating BECs. We use the split-step Crank–Nicolson algorithm for imaginary- and real-time propagation to calculate stationary states and BEC dynamics, respectively. The simulation input parameters for the C programs are provided via input files, while for the Fortran programs they are given at the beginning of each program and therefore their change requires recompilation of the corresponding program. The programs propagate the condensate wave function and calculate several relevant physical quantities, such as the energy, the chemical potential, and the root-mean-square sizes. The imaginary-time propagation starts with an analytic wave function with one vortex at the trap center, modulated by a random phase at different space points. Nevertheless, the converged wave function for a rapidly rotating BEC with a large number of vortices is most efficiently calculated using the pre-calculated converged wave function of a rotating BEC containing a smaller number of vortices as the initial state rather than using an analytic wave function with one vortex as the initial state. These pre-calculated initial states exhibit rapid convergence for fast-rotating condensates to states containing multiple vortices with an appropriate phase structure. This is illustrated here by calculating vortex lattices with up to 61 vortices in 2D and 3D. Outputs of the programs include calculated physical quantities, as well as the wave function and different density profiles (full density, integrated densities in lower dimensions, and density cross-sections). The provided real-time propagation programs can be used to study the dynamics of a rotating BEC using the imaginary-time stationary wave function as the initial state.

Long-term stable polymorphism at the host and parasite coevolving loci is characteristic of trench warfare, and is expected to promote molecular signatures of balancing selection, while the recurrent allele fixation in arms races should generate selective sweeps. We compare these two scenarios using a finite size haploid gene-for-gene model that includes both mutation and genetic drift. We first show that trench warfare do not necessarily display larger numbers of coevolutionary cycles per unit of time than arms races. We subsequently perform coalescent simulations under these dynamics to generate sequences at both host and parasite loci. Genomic footprints of recurrent selective sweeps are often found, whereas trench warfare yield signatures of balancing selection only in parasite sequences, and only in a limited parameter space. Our results suggest that deterministic models of coevolution with infinite population sizes do not predict reliably the observed genomic signatures, and it may be best to study parasite rather than host populations to find genomic signatures of coevolution such as selective sweeps or balancing selection.",10.5061/dryad.bf6m4,Genetic Drift|Population Genetics|Coevolution|Models/Simulations,"Section of Evolutionary Biology, LMU BioCenter, Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München|Section of Population Genetics, Center of Life and Food Sciences Weihenstephan, Technische Universität München",,,2014-04-09,DRYAD,Data from: Speed of adaptation and genomic footprints of host-parasite coevolution under arms race and trench warfare dynamics,,

The data are stored every 4 original simulation nodes and contains 52*49*64 nodes. The corresponding x, y and z coordinate are also stored in the .mat file. In the ""temperature_conjugate.mat"" file, the variables ending with ""_solid"" represents the quantities in the solid domain.

If the data point is the exact point stored in the data, just use the matrix to get the value. The data at the point (x,y,z)=( x(i), y(j), z(k) ) is stored at (j,i,k) in the time-averaged statistic matrix (x and y are swapped). For example, if you want the time-averaged u velocity (um) at (x, y, z)=(1.5, 0.3203, 0). First look at the vectors 'x' and we found x=1.5 corresponds to the 25th element in the vector 'x'. And y is the 17th, z is the 32nd, i.e. (x, y, z)=(1.5, 0.3203, 0)=( x(25), y(17), z(32) ). Then um(17,25,32) contains the data at this point.

We compiled a spatio-temporally comprehensive dataset of influenza B viruses, comprising over 2,500 genomes sampled worldwide between 1987 and 2015, including 382 newly-sequenced genomes that fill substantial gaps in previous molecular surveillance studies. Our contributed data increase the number of available influenza B virus genomes in Europe, Africa and Central Asia, improving the global context to study influenza B viruses. We reveal Yamagata-lineage diversity results from co-circulation of two antigenically-distinct groups that also segregate genetically across the entire genome, without evidence of intra-lineage reassortment. In contrast, Victoria-lineage diversity stems from geographic segregation of different genetic clades, with variability in the degree of geographic spread among clades. Differences between the lineages are reflected in their antigenic dynamics, as Yamagata-lineage viruses show alternating dominance between antigenic groups, while Victoria-lineage viruses show antigenic drift of a single lineage. Structural mapping of amino acid substitutions on trunk branches of influenza B gene phylogenies further supports these antigenic differences and highlights two potential mechanisms of adaptation for polymerase activity.

,"Chiu, Cathleen Tsz Ka",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-589786,DATASET,,"11/20/2016 The proper construction of an organ is crucial for its function. To attain the desired physical architecture, the interactions of a cell with neighboring cells, the extracellular environment, and the soluble local and systemic cues held within that environment must be perfectly choreographed. The presented studies sought to explore these important biological features in the context of organogenesis. While this topic has been explored in other organ models, the feather bud offers a unique advantage in its complex architecture and representation of a multitude of cellular events embodied in a surgically and chemically manipulatable organ. Though research in the feather field has amassed a wealth of information pertaining to molecular signaling and stem cell biology, the dynamics of the ECM environment and the possible involvement of PCP signaling are not well-understood. ❧ Examination of the Laminin matrix during feather organogenesis revealed a dynamic environment in which the matrix is organized and reorganized in response to the environmental needs of the developing feather organ. Identification of an important MMP14 activity in the degradation of the Laminin matrix at the site of feather bud formation revealed a previously unknown step in feather organogenesis. This opens an avenue for further experimentation to better understand how the microenvironment may be manipulated for the purposes of tissue engineering. The observed cellular dynamics identified a local region of directed cellular movement that may be an important part of feather bud development. In addition, the heterogeneous composition of the Laminin matrix suggests the localization of the various Laminin types in different regions of the feather bud basement membrane may correspond with differential cell-ECM interactions. Further studies to identify specific cell-surface receptors, their binding partners, and their differential localization will help to elucidate the particular interactions or signaling modules that facilitate the different cellular events involved in feather bud development. ❧ The Collagen III matrix provides another example of an extremely dynamic environment. The dramatic changes observed during feather bud development and their coincidence with regional differences (e.g. bud vs. interbud and proximal vs. distal feather bud) and developmental stages (e.g. achieving competency in the feather field, progression from a symmetric to asymmetric organ, and development of secondary barb ridge structures) supports the importance of the ECM environment during organogenesis. The size of the developing feather bud makes it particularly valuable for visualizing the organization of the matrix in its entirety within one organ unit, a particularly difficult task in many organ models. Further studies to identify the MMP responsible for remodeling the Collagen III matrix will be invaluable to understanding the regulation of its dynamics. The identification of cell surface receptors and their regional localization will be important in understanding how cells in the feather bud are differentially interacting with the Collagen III environment and what role those interactions play in the branching morphogenesis. ❧ Lastly, while PCP signaling has been found to be involved in chondrogenesis in the avian model, a role had not been previously established in feather bud development. The stringently aligned structure of the developing barb ridge and the loss of proper axial and marginal plate alignment following Stbm overexpression strongly suggests a possible role for Stbm in maintaining the cellular polarity. Further studies will be needed to determine whether Stbm and SHH have the same mutually-regulating relationship in branching morphogenesis as was found in neural tube development and address whether Stbm-SHH is responsible for modifying the architectural spacing of barb ridges. The perturbation of the overall embryonic feather follicle shape following overexpression of Fz-7, likewise, requires more examination to determine the mechanism by which it is exerting its effect on peridermal convergent extension. Furthermore, it will be important to identify the Fz-7-binding Wnt ligand to distinguish the molecular signaling pathway involved in regulating feather follicle curvature. ❧ Exploration of biological architectural design and how that is manifested through biophysical and biochemical properties characteristic of various aspects of organogenesis is valuable for furthering the field of tissue engineering. The presented studies explore cellular dynamics, extracellular environment, and molecular signaling and demonstrate that the feather bud model can be a powerful tool that can lend itself to developing strategies for regenerative medicine.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-589786,feather|collagen|fluorescence resonance energy transfer|cellular dynamics|organogenesis|Prinomastat|MMP|Tranilast|Pathobiology|fibronectin|organ morphogenesis|matrix metalloproteinase|laminin|FRET|ARP-100|extracellular matrix,,,,2016-01-01,usc.dl,The shaping of feather development,,

South America was the cradle of their evolutionary history. During the Tertiary, xenarthrans experienced an extraordinary radiation, whereas South America remained isolated from other continents. The 13 living genera are relics of this earlier diversification and represent one of the four major clades of placental mammals. Sequences of the three independent protein-coding nuclear markers alpha2B adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B), breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA1), and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) were determined for 12 of the 13 living xenarthran genera. Comparative evolutionary dynamics of these nuclear exons using a likelihood framework revealed contrasting patterns of molecular evolution. All codon positions of BRCA1 were shown to evolve in a strikingly similar manner, and third codon positions appeared less saturated within placentals than those of ADRA2B and VWF. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of a 47 placental taxa data set rooted by three marsupial outgroups resolved the phylogeny of Xenarthra with some evidence for two radiation events in armadillos and provided a strongly supported picture of placental interordinal relationships. This topology was fully compatible with recent studies, dividing placentals into the Southern Hemisphere clades Afrotheria and Xenarthra and a monophyletic Northern Hemisphere clade (Boreoeutheria) composed of Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. Partitioned likelihood statistical tests of the position of the root, under different character partition schemes, identified three almost equally likely hypotheses for early placental divergences: a basal Afrotheria, an Afrotheria + Xenarthra clade, or a basal Xenarthra (Epitheria hypothesis). We took advantage of the extensive sampling realized within Xenarthra to assess its impact on the location of the root on the placental tree. By resampling taxa within Xenarthra, the conservative Shimodaira-Hasegawa likelihood-based test of alternative topologies was shown to be sensitive to both character and taxon sampling.",10.5061/dryad.1831,taxon and character sampling|placentals|Bayesian phylogenetics|evolutionary dynamics|maximum likelihood|xenarthran phylogeny|nuclear markers,,Placentalia|Dasypus|Mammalia|Xenarthra|Choloepus|Myrmecophaga,,2010-08-10,DRYAD,Data from: Molecular phylogeny of living xenarthrans and the impact of character and taxon sampling on the placental tree rooting,,

This data repository provides raw datasets for accompanying the paper, ""Encoding growth factor identity in the temporal dynamics of FoxO3 under combinatorial regulation by ERK and Akt"" by Sampattavanich et al., Cell Systems (2018)

Synopsis:
Forkhead box O3 transcription factor (FoxO3) functions as an integrative node for diverse upstream signaling networks, and has been implicated in a number of biological processes including cycle arrest, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cell migration and cell metabolism. Regulators of FoxO3, including phosphorylation, energy stress, genotoxic stress, and cytokines, control its abundance, subcellular localization and DNA-binding capacity. In this paper we study how the identities and concentrations of growth factors are encoded in the dynamics of FoxO3 activation. Transcription factors like FoxO3 often switch between on and off states repeatedly over the course of a 12-24 hours period. Immunoblotting and similar methods can obscure this switching behavior due to asynchronicity between cells. In contrast, our use of time-lapse microscopy of fluorescent reporter proteins reveals that FoxO3 exhibits complex low wavelength and pulsatile translocation dynamics responsive to combinatorial control by ERK and Akt with the potential to encode the identities and concentrations of multiple extracellular growth factors.

Studies presented in this dissertation examine feasibility of probing local DNA structural and dynamic features using a class of nitroxides that are linked to chemically substituted phosphorothioate positions at the DNA backbone (R5-series). Two members of this family, designated as R5 and R5a, were attached to multiple sites of a dodecameric DNA duplex without severely perturbing the native B-form conformation. Measured X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, which report on nitroxide rotational motions, were found to vary depending on the location of the label and the identity of a phosphorothioate diastereomer (Rp or Sp). Spectral simulations and molecular modeling have been used to define basic principles for correlating observed variation in EPR spectra with site-specific structural and dynamic features in DNA. Overall, these studies advance our understanding of coupling between DNA and R5/R5a, which may ultimately enable the use of nucleotide-independent probes to obtain quantitative description of sequence-specific properties in large biologically relevant DNA molecules.",10.25549/usctheses-m3729,Chemistry|Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)|spectroscopy|DNA structure and dynamics|Site-Directed Spin Labeling (SDSL)|nitroxide label,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Sensing sequence-specific DNA micro-environment with nucleotide-independent nitroxides,,

Cultivation-dependent analyses (PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and rRNA gene sequencing) and cultivation-independent analyses (PCR-DGGE, qPCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing) were conducted on the time series samples collected from three independent indigenous soidon fermentation batches. The current findings revealed three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to attain a stable ecosystem within 7 days natural fermentation of bamboo shoots. Weissella spp. (Weissella cibaria, uncultured Weissella ghanensis) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris predominated the early phase (1–2 days) which was joined by Leuconostoc citreum during the mid-phase (3 days), while Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum emerged and became dominant in the late phase (5–7 days) with concurrent disappearance of W. cibaria and L. lactis subsp. cremoris. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and uncultured Lactobacillus acetotolerans were predominantly present throughout the fermentation with no visible dynamics. The above identified dominant bacterial species along with their dynamics can be effectively utilized for designing a starter culture for industrialization of soidon production. Our results showed that a more realistic view on the microbial ecology of soidon fermentation could be obtained by cultivation-dependent studies complemented with cultivation-independent molecular approaches. Moreover, the critical issues to be considered for reducing methodological biases while studying the microbial ecology of traditional food fermentation were also highlighted with this soidon fermentation model.",10.5061/dryad.cs4h8,Metagenomics|Microbial Biology|Bacteria|Population Dynamics,"Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University|Microbial Resources Division, Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development (IBSD)",Leuconostoc lactis|Leuconostoc mesenteroides|Pseudomonas koreensis|Hanseniaspora thailandica|Lactobacillus plantarum|Erwinia billingiae|Candida humilis|Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris|Leuconostoc citreum|Weissella oryzae|Raoultella terrigena|Weissella cibaria|Lactococcus raffinolactis|Candida oleophila|Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis|Lactobacillus brevis|Enterobacter asburiae|Pediococcus pentosaceus|Kazachstania sp.|Vagococcus fluvialis,,2015-05-08,DRYAD,Data from: Three-phase succession of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria to reach a stable ecosystem within seven days of natural bamboo shoot fermentation as revealed by different molecular approaches,,

Results: We combined Illumina and PacBio technologies to complete the genome sequence of D. solani strain 3337 that was used as a reference to compare with 19 other genomes (including that of the type strain IPO2222 T ) which were generated by Illumina technology. This population genomic analysis highlighted an unexpected variability among D. solani isolates since it led to the characterization of two distinct sub-groups within the D. solani species. This approach also revealed different types of variations such as scattered SNP/InDel variations as well as replacing and additive horizontal gene transfers (HGT). Infra-species (between the two D. solani sub-groups) and inter-species (between D. solani and D. dianthicola) replacing HGTs were observed. Finally, this work pointed that genetic and functional variation in the motility trait could contribute to aggressiveness variability in D. solani. Conclusions: This work revealed that D. solani genomic variability may be caused by SNPs/InDels as well as replacing and additive HGT events, including plasmid acquisition; hence the D. solani genomes are more dynamic than that were previously proposed.

The position and orientation of a number of different H1 globular domains on the nucleosome were investigated through molecular docking using MGLTools and HADDOCK. The nucleosome core and linker DNA in the GH5-chromatosome structure (PDB: 4QLC) were used as a docking template. GH5 (in PDB: 4QLC) was re-docked to this template to test the docking algorithm. 

Docked and re-docked GH5 compared well. The docking algorithm was further tested by docking the NMR solution structure of the globular domain of chicken H1 (GH1, PDB: 1GHC) to the nucleosome template. The position of docked GH1 on the nucleosome agreed with literature.

 The N-terminal - and globular domain H1x hybrid (NGH1x) was studied using solution NMR in both low (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and high (20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M sodium perchlorate, pH 7.0) ionic strength conditions (de Wit, H., Vallet, A., Brutscher, B. et al. Biomol NMR Assign (2019) 13: 249. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12104-019-09886-x). These low and high ionic strength structures were docked to the nucleosome template. 

 Homology (MODELLER) and ab initio modeling (CS-ROSETTA) were employed to model structures for other human H1 globular domains: GH1.0, GH1.4, GH1oo, and GH1t. The modeled structures were also docked to the nucleosome template. 

All the docking procedures listed above produced 100 models of different energies. In each case, the lowest energy docked model was chosen. The structures of all the H1 globular domains that were docked to the template are given as PDB files (1GHC_lowest_energy.pdb; 2LSO_lowest_energy.pdb; GH5_re-docked_position.pdb; NGH1x_high_salt_NTD.pdb; NGH1x_low_salt_NTD.pdb; modeled_GH1_0_lowest_energy.pdb; modeled_GH1_4_lowest_energy.pdb; modeled_GH1oo_lowest_energy.pdb; modelled_GH1t_lowest_energy.pdb) in the data file.

Abstract 
CPPPO is a compilation of parallel data processing routines developed with the aim to create a library for “scale bridging” (i.e. connecting different scales by mean of closure models) in a multi-scale approach. CPPPO features a number of parallel filtering algorithms designed for use with structured and unstructured Eulerian meshes, as well as Lagrangian data sets. In addition, data can be processed on the fly, allowing the collection of relevant statistics without saving individual snapshot...

First this method of massively parallel and deep sequencing enables assessment of a comprehensive panel of genomic targets from a single sample, and second, it obviates the need for repeat invasive tissue biopsies. Digital SequencingTM is a novel method for high-quality sequencing of circulating tumor DNA simultaneously across a comprehensive panel of over 50 cancer-related genes with a simple blood test. Here we report the analytic and clinical validation of the gene panel. Analytic sensitivity down to 0.1% mutant allele fraction is demonstrated via serial dilution studies of known samples. Near-perfect analytic specificity (&gt; 99.9999%) enables complete coverage of many genes without the false positives typically seen with traditional sequencing assays at mutant allele frequencies or fractions below 5%. We compared digital sequencing of plasma-derived cell-free DNA to tissue-based sequencing on 165 consecutive matched samples from five outside centers in patients with stage III-IV solid tumor cancers. Clinical sensitivity of plasma-derived NGS was 85.0%, comparable to 80.7% sensitivity for tissue. The assay success rate on 1,000 consecutive samples in clinical practice was 99.8%. Digital sequencing of plasma-derived DNA is indicated in advanced cancer patients to prevent repeated invasive biopsies when the initial biopsy is inadequate, unobtainable for genomic testing, or uninformative, or when the patient’s cancer has progressed despite treatment. Its clinical utility is derived from reduction in the costs, complications and delays associated with invasive tissue biopsies for genomic testing.",10.5061/dryad.92pd3,next-generation sequencing|clinical validation|matched therapy|cell-free DNA|analytic validation|circulating tumor DNA|gene panel,Saint John's Health Center|Department of Medicine|Department of Molecular Oncology|Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology|Inc.|Samsung Medical Center|Department of Medical Affairs|Administration|Department of Research and Bioinformatics|Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine|Rainier Hematology Oncology|Northwest Medical Specialties|Division of Hematology-Oncology|Guardant Health|University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center|Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology|University Cancer and Blood Center|John Wayne Cancer Institute|University of California San Francisco School of Medicine|Genesis Cancer Center,,,2015-10-19,DRYAD,"Data from: Analytical and clinical validation of a digital sequencing panel for quantitative, highly accurate evaluation of cell-free circulating tumor DNA",,

This thesis explores the possible application of doped polyaniline (PANI) fibers for recovering and producing water from atmospheric sources.; Chapter 2 details the measurements carried out for the sorption equilibrium and transport of water into commercially-produced PANI solid fibers from a 50% relative humidity air stream at ambient pressure of ~0.1 MPa and temperature 300 K. The data were collected using a single solid fiber morphology, PANION, but with different acid dopants used to change the PANI from its emeraldine base (EB; insulating), PANI-EB, to the emeraldine salt (ES; conducting) form, PANI-ES. The sorption process was well-described by the unsteady Fickian diffusion into an infinite cylinder. The rates and equilibrium capacities depended on the acid dopant utilized, but did not vary monotonically with the anion size or the acid strength. The measured adsorption/desorption water capacities varied between 20 and 75 mg H2O/g dry polymer, depending on the anion dopant. The BF4- and H2PO4- doped fibers had the highest capacities. When the mass loading was recalculated on a per H2O molecule/polymer repeat unit basis, most doped fibers had a capacity of ~0.5 H2O per PANI-ES repeat unit. The exceptions were the BF4- and H2PO4- doped fibers, for which the value was ~1. The apparent diffusion coefficients varied between 0.07-0.39 x 10-12 m2/s, and were larger during adsorption than desorption. The water capacity of the PANI solid fibers is at the upper-end of what is usually observed for glassy polymers, and provides the possibility for exploiting its electronic conductivity, good mechanical strength, and desiccant qualities for water recovery from atmospheric sources, as well as for advanced humidity control and sensing applications.; Chapter 3 presents the measurements performed for the sorption equilibrium and transport of water vapor into PANI asymmetric, microporous hollow fibers doped with phosphoric acid (H3PO4).  The data were obtained under exposure to air streams at an ambient pressure of ~0.1 MPa at various relative humidities and temperatures of 300 - 309 K. The sorption process was well-described by the unsteady Fickian diffusion into an infinite hollow cylinder. The asymmetric and porous nature of the hollow fiber's wall was represented by using an effective medium approach. The quantitative adsorption/desorption rates and equilibrium capacities depended on the experimental conditions, with the measured water capacities being between 33 and 75 mg H2O/g dry polymer under most conditions, though at the highest relative humidity(~80% at 300 K) the fiber adsorbed almost 250 mg H2O/g. For relative humidities ≤50%, when the mass loading was recalculated on a per H2O molecule/polymer repeat unit basis, the fiber had a capacity of ~0.5 to 1 H2O per PANI-ES repeat unit. In this same range of humidities, the apparent diffusion coefficients varied between 0.21-0.67 x 10-12 m2/s, except for the case of desorption at 80% RH wherein a value of 2.38 x 10-12 m2/s was obtained. In general, the apparent diffusion coefficients were always larger during desorption than adsorption. The water capacity of the PANI hollow fibers was found to be similar to that of the solid fiber (with the same dopant) under similar conditions.; Chapter 4 describes the atomistic simulation carried out for diffusion and sorption of water in polyaniline doped with HCl and HBr. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation techniques were used to develop atomistic models of HCl- and HBr- doped conducting PANI and to study diffusion and adsorption of water vapor in these polymers. Various morphological properties of the polymers were computed, including their pair correlation functions that were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data, and their accessible free volumes. The sorption isotherms and self-diffusivity of water vapor in the polymers were also computed at various temperatures. The computed sorption isotherms were in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data, while the diffusivities were within an order of magnitude of the data. The computed activation energy compared well with that published in the literature for water sorption in doped polyaniline.",10.25549/usctheses-m581,diffusion|adsorption|polyaniline|Chemical Engineering,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Experimental and atomistic simulation studies of water sorption in polyaniline,,

While many studies are increasingly producing results on the importance of selection, little is known about the interaction between drift and selection. Moreover there is still little knowledge on the spatial-temporal scales at which speciation occurs, i.e. arrangement of habitat patches, abruptness of habitat transitions, climate and habitat changes interacting with selective forces. To investigate these questions, we quantified variation on a fine geographical scale analysing morphological (shell) and genetic datasets coupled with environmental data in the land snail Murella muralis, endemic to the Mediterranean island of Sicily. Analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI) and eight nuclear microsatellite loci showed that genetic variation is highly structured at a very fine spatial scale by local palaeogeographical events and historical population dynamics. Molecular clock estimates, calibrated here specifically for Tyrrhenian land snails, provided a framework of palaeogeographical events responsible for the observed geographical variations and migration routes. Finally, we showed for the first time well documented lines of evidences of selection in the past, which explains divergence of land snail shell shapes. We suggest that time and palaeogeographical history acted as constraints in the progress along the ecological speciation continuum. Our study shows that testing for correlation among palaeogeography, morphology and genetic data on a fine geographical scale provides information fundamental for a detailed understanding of ecological speciation processes.",10.5061/dryad.v84jr,Molluscs|Phylogeography|Speciation|Population Genetics - Empirical,Department of Environmental Sciences|University of Potsdam|University of Siena|Institute of Biochemistry and Biology|University of Rome Sapienza|Department of Biology and Biotechnology Charles Darwin|Unit of Evolutionary Biology/Systematic Zoology,Murella muralis,,2012-10-10,DRYAD,Data from: A question of time: the land snail Murella muralis (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) reveals constrains to past ecological speciation,,

Movies were then processed with slimFAST_2 for particle localization and tracking according to parameters listed in the README file. Data from slimFAST_2 was further processed using evalSPT to obtain a format suitable for further downstream processing. 

The output from evalSPT_3 is then used as input for Matlab script spt_process_v15CR.m file. The resulting data structure (sptana) contains metadata, nuclear segmented binding trajectories, and nuclear segmented dwell times for binding trajectories (ndwet). Each row is a separate cell. Sptana data structures should from 2 channel SMT should be organized to have subsequent rows containing cells from channel 1 data followed by subsequent rows of matched cells from channel 2. For example, 10 cells of 2 channel SMT should have rows 1-10 channel 1 information from Cells A-J followed by rows 11-20 channel 2 information from Cells A-J.

The sptana data structure containing matched cells with 2 channels of tracking is used by the livecellColocV1CR.m file to isolate spatially and temporally colocalized molecules. The output This program saves the following values, percentages of molecules colocalized in each cell (perColoc), percentages of molecules temporally colocalized in each cell (perClcT),aggregated arrival/departure times of channel/color 2 molecules with respect to channel/color 1 (ADBag), aggregated colocalization times (ClcTag), and a cell structure containing a table with all molecular IDs, arrival departure frames, XY position, arrival/departure times of channel/color 2 with respect to channel/color 1 (FinalMoldata)).

The sptana data structure is used by sptclst_v24CR.m file to generate maps of hubs(clusters) of binding events. The resulting data structure (sptclst) contains metadata, cluster numbers, locations and Molecular IDs of binding events in clusters.

  landscapes impacts numerous ecosystem functions and services provided
  by urban streams. Urban stream restoration is often employed to offset
  these impacts and conserve or enhance the various functions and
  services these streams provide. Despite the assumption that ‘if you
  build it, [the function] will come’, current understanding of the
  effects of urban stream restoration on stream ecosystem functions are
  based on short term studies which may not capture variation in
  restoration effectiveness over time. We quantified the impact of
  stream restoration on nutrient and energy dynamics of urban streams by
  studying 10 urban stream reaches (five restored, five unrestored) in
  the Baltimore, Maryland, USA, region over a two-year period. We
  measured gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER)
  at the whole-stream scale continuously throughout the study and
  nitrate (NO3-N) spiraling rates seasonally (spring, summer, autumn)
  across all reaches. There was no significant restoration effect on
  NO3-N spiraling across reaches. However, there was a significant
  canopy cover effect on NO3-N spiraling, and directly comparing paired
  sets of unrestored-restored reaches showed that restoration does
  affect NO3-N spiraling after accounting for other environmental
  variation. Furthermore, there was a change in GPP:ER seasonality, with
  restored and open-canopied reaches exhibiting higher GPP:ER during
  summer. The restoration effect, though, appears contingent upon
  altered canopy cover, which is likely to be a temporary effect of
  restoration and is a driver of multiple ecosystem services, e.g.,
  habitat, riparian nutrient processing. Our results suggest that
  decision-making about stream restoration, including evaluations of
  nutrient benefits, clearly needs to consider spatial and temporal
  dynamics of canopy cover and tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem
  services.

      
  Here we provide model estimates for GPP, ER, and net ecosystem
  productivity (NEP) from from 10 sites throughout the greater Baltimore
  area. These estimates are included in the manuscript “Seeing the

The Amazon basin is thought to hold 30% of all river fish species in the world. Information about the ecology, reproduction, and recruitment of most species is still lacking, thus hampering fisheries management and successful conservation strategies. One of the key understudied issues in the study of population dynamics is recruitment. Fish larval ecology in tropical biomes is still in its infancy owing to identification difficulties. Molecular techniques are very promising tools for the identification of larvae at the species level. However, one of their limits is obtaining individual sequences with large samples of larvae. To facilitate this task, we developed a new method based on the massive parallel sequencing capability of next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with hybridization capture. We focused on the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase I (COI). The results obtained using the new method were compared with individual larval sequencing. We validated the ability of the method to identify Amazonian catfish larvae at the species level and to estimate the relative abundance of species in batches of larvae. Finally, we applied the method and provided evidence for strong temporal variation in reproductive activity of catfish species in the Ucayalí River in the Peruvian Amazon. This new time and cost effective method enables the acquisition of large datasets, paving the way for a finer understanding of reproductive dynamics and recruitment patterns of tropical fish species, with major implications for fisheries management and conservation.",10.5061/dryad.117tn,,ULRA-UMSS|Montpellier-SupAgro|Unité Mixte de Recherche Diversité Adaptation et Développement des Plantes|Institut de Recherche pour le Développement|Laboratoire Mixte International-Evolution et Domestication de l'Ichtyofaune Amazonienne (LMI-EDIA)|Université de Montpellier|UMR BOREA|IIAP-UAGRM-IRD|Institut des Sciences de l'Évolution (UMR ISEM)|Centre de Biologie pour la Gestion des Populations (UMR CBGP)|Laboratorio de Biología y Genética Molecular (LBGM)|Unité Mixte de Recherche Biologie des Organismes et Ecosystèmes Aquatiques (UMR BOREA)|Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana (IIAP)|Université Montpellier-CNRS-IRD-EPHE|FAUNAGUA|MNHN-CNRS-7208-UPMC-UCBN-IRD-207|ECOSINTEGRALES SRL,,,2016-12-29,DRYAD,Data from: DNA metabarcoding of Amazonian ichthyoplankton swarms,,

These are the raw read count matrices along side the barcode for the cells and genes that span the sparse matrix. These results are published in Development: Defining epithelial cell dynamics and lineage relationships in the developing lacrimal gland.Abstract:The tear producing lacrimal gland is a tubular organ that protects and lubricates the ocular surface. While the lacrimal gland possesses many features that make it an excellent model to understand tubulogenesis, the cell types and lineage relationships that drive lacrimal gland formation are unclear. Using single cell sequencing and other molecular tools, we reveal novel cell identities and epithelial lineage dynamics that underlie lacrimal gland development. We show that the lacrimal gland from its earliest developmental stages is composed of multiple subpopulations of immune, epithelial, and mesenchymal cell lineages. The epithelial lineage exhibits the most substantiative cellular changes, transitioning through a series of unique transcriptional states to become terminally differentiated acinar, ductal and myoepithelial cells. Furthermore, lineage tracing in postnatal and adult glands provides the first direct evidence of unipotent KRT5+ epithelial cells in the lacrimal gland. Finally, we show conservation of developmental markers between the developing mouse and human lacrimal gland, supporting the use of mice to understand human development. Together, our data reveal critical features of lacrimal gland development that have broad implications for understanding epithelial organogenesis.,Gathered via 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline for scRNA seq.

Whether the same process governs lineage accumulation and trait disparity during continental colonization events is less clear. Here, we test this prediction by investigating the rate dynamics and trait evolution of one of Africa's most widespread amphibian colonizers, the true toads (Bufonidae). By reconstructing the most complete molecular phylogeny of African Bufonidae to date, we find that the diversification of lineages in Africa best conforms to a constant rate model throughout time and across subclades, with little support for EO. Evolutionary rates of life-history traits have similarly been constant over time. However, an analysis of generalists and specialists showed a shift toward higher speciation rates associated with habitat specialization. The overall lack of EO signal can be interpreted in a number of ways and we propose several explanations. Firstly, methodological issues might preclude the detection of EO. Secondly, colonizers might not experience true EO conditions and due to the size, ecological heterogeneity and age of landmasses, the diversification processes might be more complex.

We found that the urban landscape played a significant role in shaping FIV transmission. Even though bobcats were often trapped within the urban matrix, FIV transmission events were more likely to occur in areas with more natural habitat elements. Urban fragmentation also resulted in lower rates of pathogen evolution, possibly owing to a narrower range of host genotypes in the fragmented area.

The co-existence of these service types has brought considerable research interest on service type heterogeneity in Web Service composition. The research question of SLR is ""How are services of heterogeneous types (SOAP, RESTful and \event-oriented services) composed?"".

Documents that may answer this question were searched in Scopus and IEEE Xplore, from conferences and journal sources, without a time limit. Search results were last updated in July 22, 2018 and yielded 63 relevant documents published from 2005 to 2018.

Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species interactions across trophic levels, e.g. pollination and biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multi-trophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulations in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. 2. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model’s ability to replicate temporally non-aggregated abundance data from the field, and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. 3. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. 4. The model captured &gt;70% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body-size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community’s abundance and trait composition. Analyzing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. 5. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.",10.5061/dryad.41b5b06,allometry|agricultural pests|species traits|body mass|conservation biological control|multi-trophic functioning|predator-prey interactions|herbivore suppression,,Bembidion|Coccinella|Pterostichus|Carabidae|Rhopalosiphum padi|Araneae|Thysanoptera|Linyphiidae|Lumbricidae|Lycosidae|Harpalus|Poecilus|Collembola|Diptera|Tetragnathidae,,2018-08-08,DRYAD,Data from: Ecosystem function in predator-prey food webs - confronting dynamic models with empirical data,,

  landscapes impacts numerous ecosystem functions and services provided
  by urban streams. Urban stream restoration is often employed to offset
  these impacts and conserve or enhance the various functions and
  services these streams provide. Despite the assumption that ‘if you
  build it, [the function] will come’, current understanding of the
  effects of urban stream restoration on stream ecosystem functions are
  based on short term studies which may not capture variation in
  restoration effectiveness over time. We quantified the impact of
  stream restoration on nutrient and energy dynamics of urban streams by
  studying 10 urban stream reaches (five restored, five unrestored) in
  the Baltimore, Maryland, USA, region over a two-year period. We
  measured gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER)
  at the whole-stream scale continuously throughout the study and
  nitrate (NO3-N) spiraling rates seasonally (spring, summer, autumn)
  across all reaches. There was no significant restoration effect on
  NO3-N spiraling across reaches. However, there was a significant
  canopy cover effect on NO3-N spiraling, and directly comparing paired
  sets of unrestored-restored reaches showed that restoration does
  affect NO3-N spiraling after accounting for other environmental
  variation. Furthermore, there was a change in GPP:ER seasonality, with
  restored and open-canopied reaches exhibiting higher GPP:ER during
  summer. The restoration effect, though, appears contingent upon
  altered canopy cover, which is likely to be a temporary effect of
  restoration and is a driver of multiple ecosystem services, e.g.,
  habitat, riparian nutrient processing. Our results suggest that
  decision-making about stream restoration, including evaluations of
  nutrient benefits, clearly needs to consider spatial and temporal
  dynamics of canopy cover and tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem
  services.

Linking organismal level processes to underlying suborganismal mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and organ level constitutes a major challenge for predictive ecological risk assessments. This challenge can be addressed with the simple bioenergetic models in the family of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB), which consist of a small number of state equations quantifying universal processes, such as feeding, maintenance, development, reproduction and growth. 2. Motivated by the need for process-based models to evaluate the impact of endocrine disruptors on ecologically relevant endpoints, this paper develops and evaluates two general modeling modules describing demand-driven feedback mechanisms within the DEB modeling framework exerted by gonads on the allocation of resources to production of reproductive matter. 3. These modules describe iteroparous, semelparous and batch-mode reproductive strategies. The modules have a generic form with both positive and negative feedback components; species and sex specific attributes of endocrine regulation can be added without changing the core of the modules. 4. We demonstrate that these modules successfully describe time-resolved measurements of wet weight of body, ovaries and liver, egg diameter and plasma content of vitellogenin and estradiol in rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss) by fitting these models to published and new data, which require the estimation of less than two parameters per data type. 5.

A number of experimental and modelling studies in the past have investigated multivalent ligand-mediated aggregation of IgE receptors (FcɛRI) in the plasma membrane of mast cells. However, understanding of the mechanisms of FcɛRI aggregation remains incomplete. Experimental reports indicate that FcɛRI forms relatively small and finite-sized clusters when stimulated by a multivalent ligand. By contrast, modelling studies have shown that receptor cross-linking by a trivalent ligand may lead to the formation of large receptor superaggregates that may potentially give rise to hyperactive cellular responses. In this work, we have developed a Brownian dynamics-based spatio-temporal model to analyse FcɛRI aggregation by a trivalent antigen. Unlike the existing models, which implemented non-spatial simulation approaches, our model explicitly accounts for the coarse-grained site-specific features of the multivalent species (molecules and complexes). The model incorporates membrane diffusion, steric collisions and sub-nanometre-scale site-specific interaction of the time-evolving species of arbitrary structures. Using the model, we investigated temporal evolution of the species and their diffusivities. Consistent with a recent experimental report, our model predicted sharp decay in species mobility in the plasma membrane in response receptor cross-linking by a multivalent antigen. We show that, due to such decay in the species mobility, post-stimulation receptor aggregation may become self-limiting. Our analysis reveals a potential regulatory mechanism suppressing hyperactivation of immune cells in response to multivalent antigens.",10.6084/m9.figshare.7127366,Immunology|60114 Systems Biology|Biophysics,,,,2018-01-01,figshare.ars,Simulation code: spatial model from A spatio-temporal model reveals self-limiting FcɛRI cross-linking by multivalent antigens,,

We know that many biological factors, including plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microbes, regulate plant survival and the carbon-balance of arctic tundra, but these interactions are poorly understood. Recently, new advances in technology have allowed us to study belowground communities with resolution not previously possible, leading to new findings about the links between below and above ground community dynamics. Our research uses cutting-edge technology such as stable isotope tracing and molecular methods to investigate the role of soil microbial communities in the response of an Arctic ecosystem to climate change. We found that 1) mycorrhizal fungal networks link plants in tundra and play a critical role in the expansion of shrubs in Arctic landscapes with climate change; 2) as climate warms, tundra shrubs increasingly partner with mycorrhizal fungi that are specialized in the breakdown of the organic carbon stored in tundra soils; and 3) climate warming will alter the diversity and composition of free-living soil microbial communities in Arctic tundra and these changes will also lead to increased losses of carbon from soils. Our data suggest that microbial community change in Arctic tundra will act as a positive feedback to climate change, speeding up the rate of change in Low-Arctic tundra ecosystems.,Purpose: Effects of anthropogenic climate change have now been reported in all of the earth's biomes (Rosenzwieg et al. 2008) but Arctic regions, which sustain the highest rates of warming (Trenberth et al. 2007), have been particularly perturbed (Post et al. 2009). The stability of terrestrial Arctic ecosystems is of immediate concern because tundra soils store a disproportionally large share of the earth's C, and increased microbial decomposition of this C will feedback to climate on decadal timescales (Schuur et al. 2009). Soil microbes are central to the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems because of their dual role as decomposers of soil organic matter and as determinants of plant community diversity (van der Heijden et al. 2008), which in turn controls the quality and quantity of C inputs to soils (De Deyn et al. 2008, Bardgett et al. 2008). Yet, despite the importance of Arctic soils in the global C cycle, we know very little of the impacts of climate change on Arctic soil microbial communities, and even less of how these changes will feedback to the stability of tundra plant communities. In ""Carbon-flux and Microbial Community Dynamics in Low-Arctic Tundra"" we address critical gaps in our understanding of the role of soil microbial communities in the response of an Arctic ecosystem to climate change. Objectives: 1) To assess the ecological role of mycorrhizal networks (MNs) in plant interactions in a Low-Arctic tundra ecosystem; 2) To determine the effects of warming and increased nutrient availability on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community of a tundra shrub that is responsive to these climate change factors; 3) To determine the effects of climate warming on Arctic soil fungi and bacteria over time; 4) To assess the role of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in determining C-allocation to tundra plant rhizosphere organisms.,Summary: Arctic ecosystems store large amounts of carbon in plants and soil and this carbon may be released and contribute to carbon dioxide production as the climate warms. In the Arctic tundra however, plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microbes that regulate carbon are poorly understood. Across growing seasons, this project is investigating links between below and above ground community processes regarding carbon balance and transfer. Using new advances in technology, this work is identifying key microbial groups in the soil that are involved in the cycling of carbon in Arctic tundra and determining how carbon cycling will respond to climate change.,",10.5443/11463,Fungi|Carbon fluxes|Soils|Stable isotope tracers|Carbon dioxide|Vegetation|Bacteria|Tundra|Microbial community|International Polar Year-Carbon-flux and plant-microbial community dynamics in Low-Arctic tundra,,,,2016-01-01,cisti.ipy,Carbon-flux and Microbial Community Dynamics in Low-Arctic Tundra,,

Ten participants rhythmically manipulated a virtual cup containing a ball via a robotic manipulandum which controlled the cup position and provided haptic feedback of the force applied by the ball. The cup movement was constrained to 1 dimension. Participants were free to choose the frequency of oscillation, while the amplitude was imposed by visual constraints. The cup and ball system was represented mathematically by a cart and pendulum system. The following dimensions were used for the experiment: pendulum length = 0.45m, pendulum mass = 0.6kg, cart mass = 2.4kg.


Each participant performed 5 blocks of 10 trials. For each data file, the first 2 letters identify (anonymously) a participant, the first number identifies the block and the second number identifies the trial within the block.


The data are in Matlab data format. ""RackPosition"" (resp. Velocity, Acceleration) corresponds to the cart position (resp. velocity, acceleration). Y is the axis of the movement. ""BallTheta"" and ""BallOmega"" are the pendulum angular position and velocity. Please note that in this dataset angles are positive in clockwise direction (contrary to usual mechanical conventions). ""BallForce"" is the force applied by the pendulum on the cart.


This experimental dataset was  confronted to simulation results obtained with two different models. One (""Uncoupled Model"") only simulates the dynamics of a cart and pendulum system (Matlab script ""cup_task_uncoupled_model_inverde_dynamics.m"" and ""simulation_cup_task_uncoupled_model_inverse_dynamics.m""). Simulations of this Uncoupled Model are run using inverse dynamics, assuming a sinusoidal trajectory of the cart. The second model (""Coupled Model"") includes a simplified model of hand dynamics, represented by an ideal force generator in parallel with a spring and a damper to simulate hand impedance (Matlab and Simulink scripts ""cup_task_coupled_model.slx"" and ""simulation_coupled_model_forward_dynamics.m""). Simulations of this Coupled Model are run using forward dynamics

Tests for adaptive radiation in extant taxa are traditionally estimated from calibrated molecular phylogenies with little input from extinct taxa. With 85 putative species in 33 genera and over 400 described extinct species, the carnivoran superfamily Musteloidea is a prime candidate to investigate patterns of adaptive radiation using both extant- and fossil-based macroevolutionary methods. The species diversity and equally impressive ecological and phenotypic diversity found across Musteloidea is often attributed to 2 adaptive radiations coinciding with 2 major climate events, the Eocene-Oligocene transition and the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition. Here, we compiled a novel time-scaled phylogeny for 88% of extant musteloids and used it as a framework for testing the predictions of adaptive radiation hypotheses with respect to rates of lineage diversification and phenotypic evolution. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for rapid bursts of lineage diversification at the origin of Musteloidea, and further analyses of lineage diversification rates using molecular and fossil-based methods did not find associations between rates of lineage diversification and the Eocene-Oligocene transition or Mid-Miocene Climate Transition as previously hypothesized. Rather, we found support for decoupled diversification dynamics driven by increased clade carrying capacity in the branches leading to a subclade of elongate mustelids. Supporting decoupled diversification dynamics between the subclade of elongate mustelids and the ancestral musteloid regime is our finding of increased rates of body length evolution, but not body mass evolution, within the decoupled mustelid subclade. The lack of correspondence in rates of body mass and length evolution suggest that phenotypic evolutionary rates under a single morphological metric, even one as influential as mass, may not capture the evolution of diversity in clades that exhibit elongate body shapes. The discordance in evolutionary rates between body length and body mass along with evidence of decoupled diversification dynamics suggests that body elongation might be an innovation for the exploitation of novel Mid-Miocene resources, resulting in the radiation of some musteloids.",10.5061/dryad.nj1bp,evolutionary rates|key innovation|adaptive radiation|Phylogenetics|lineage diversification|body size evolution,University of Chicago|Department of the Geophysical Sciences|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology|University of California|Long Marine Lab|Santa Cruz,Carnivora,,2017-05-01,DRYAD,Data from: Lineage diversity and size disparity in Musteloidea: testing patterns of adaptive radiation using molecular and fossil-based methods,,

Leakiness is concerning as it increases vaccination coverage required to prevent disease spread, and can promote evolution of increased pathogen virulence. Despite leakiness, vaccination may reduce pathogen load, affecting disease transmission dynamics. However, the impacts on post-transmission disease development and infectiousness in contact individuals are unknown. Here, we use transmission experiments involving Marek’s disease virus in chickens to show that vaccination with a leaky vaccine substantially reduces viral load in both vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated contact individuals they infect. Consequently, contact birds are less likely to develop disease symptoms or die, show less severe symptoms when these are present, and shed less infectious virus themselves, when infected by vaccinated birds. These results highlight that even partial vaccination with a leaky vaccine can have unforeseen positive consequences in controlling the spread and symptoms of disease.,Data descriptions are all in the file ""MD analysis data filtering details.R"".

In this work the applicability of parameter sets for the molecular interactions of ZIF-8 including guest molecules was investigated by comparing results of MD simulations with experiments. Using suitable parameter sets, the diffusion and the effect of the diffusing molecules on the window size were investigated for ethane and nitrogen. For ethane, two interesting effects were found at higher ethane loadings: reduction of the window size and, forces that push a given molecule toward the window. These two effects balance each other leading to a self-diffusivity nearly independent upon the concentration of ethane. For nitrogen a gate-opening effect could be found. This result is in agreement with experiments. The size of the windows increases at high loadings while this does not speed-up the nitrogen self-diffusivity. The complex interactions of host-host and host-guest molecules cause mutual hindrance of the nitrogen molecules and balance the speed of the mobility due to the larger window size. Moreover, the energy barrier for rotation of imidazolate linkers was studied by quantum mechanics (QM).

It is straightforward to incorporate the code into the LAMMPS software as well as into other molecular simulation programs. In the computational part of this work, we evaluate the intramolecular entropy of atactic polystyrene and polyethylene melts in an all atom as well as in a coarse grained (CG) resolution at five temperatures between 400 and 450 K. For both polymers, coarse graining with its reduced system degrees of freedom and its softened bonded radial potential, causes a strong reduction of the entropy. However, the averaged entropy per degree of freedom in the CG case exceeds the one under atomistic resolution. Also the temperature dependence of the intramolecular entropy becomes weaker in the transition from an atomistic to a coarse grained description. The larger entropy of polyethylene in comparison to polystyrene under both resolutions is a consequence of its longer chain length. To simplify a comparison of the two polymers in the two considered resolutions, we analyze the total intramolecular entropy as well as its temperature gradient via a scaling of both quantities by the number of degrees of freedom. In the two studied systems and for both levels of resolution, a linear dependence of the intramolecular entropy on the temperature is identified.",10.17632/xn3ccj6kym.1,Computational Physics,,Computational Physics,,2018-08-22,MENDELEY_DATA,An open-source implementation of a quasi harmonic approach to compute the intramolecular entropy of particle systems,article,1

The study area was a Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) forest located in eastern Texas USA (31° 06’ 32.48’’ N, 95° 09’ 59.15’’W). In brief, the experimental design consisted of two different OMR intensities (low-intensity: bole-only harvest, BO; high intensity: whole-tree harvest + forest floor removal, WT+FF) and unharvested control forest plots, with three replicates per treatment. Treatments were harvested in 1996, and replanted with containerized P. taeda seedlings at 2.5 m x 2.5 m spacing. Soil was sampled seasonally for 1 year (June 2014, September 2014, December 2014, and March 2015). At each sample date, 4 cores were taken within each replicate plot to a depth of 1 m, and separated into depth increments (0-10, 10-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm). The four cores/plot were then pooled by depth increment and homogenized to create a single homogenous sample for each replicate plot, from which a representative subsample was removed and stored at -80 °C for molecular analyses. Microbial DNA was extracted from soil as noted in Mushinski et al. (2017).  

Quantitative-PCR (qPCR) targeting total bacteria and fungi was performed using primer pairs 1100F/1492R for bacteria  and ITS1F/ITS5.8S for fungi . The 25 μl reaction mixture contained 13 μl SYBR green real master mix (5Prime, Gaithersburg, MD), 0.5 μl of each primer (concentration 10 mM), 1 μl DNA template, and 10 μl molecular-grade water. Each analytical run included a set of standards, negative controls, and replicated samples (n = 3) on a 96-well plate. For the 16S rRNA gene, the qPCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 30 sec, 53 °C for 30 sec (40 cycles); 72 °C for 1 min. For the ITS region, the qPCR was run with the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 30 sec, 57 °C for 45 sec (30 cycles); 72 °C for 1.5 min. The qPCR was performed using a Mastercycler® ep realplex thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Amplification efficiencies of 77-80% and 84-86% were obtained for bacteria and fungi, with r2 values &gt; 0.96. Plasmids containing 16S and ITS inserts were used for the standard curves.

However, direct measurement of dispersal across a whole community is difficult at ecologically relevant spatial scales. For cryptic organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, the scale and importance of dispersal limitation has become a major point of debate. We use an experimental island biogeographic approach to measure the effects of dispersal limitation on the ecological dynamics of an important group of plant symbionts, ectomycorrhizal fungi. We manipulated the isolation of uncolonized host seedlings across a natural landscape and used a range of molecular techniques to measure dispersal rates of ectomycorrhizal propagules and host colonization. Some species were prolific dispersers, producing annual spore loads on the order of trillions of spores per km2. However, fungal propagules reaching host seedlings decreased rapidly with increasing distance from potential spore sources, causing a concomitant reduction in ectomycorrhizal species richness, host colonization, and host biomass. There were also strong differences in dispersal ability across species, which correlated well with the predictable composition of ectomycorrhizal communities associated with establishing pine forest. The use of molecular tools to measure whole community dispersal provides a direct confirmation for a key mechanism underlying island biogeography theory and has the potential to make microbial systems a model for understanding the role of dispersal in ecological theory.",10.5061/dryad.b70pn,historical contingency|dispersal limitation|biogeography|islands|metacommunities|macroecology,,,,2012-05-08,DRYAD,Data from: Measuring ectomycorrhizal fungal dispersal: macroecological patterns driven by microscopic propagules,,

Within the Afrotropics, the Congo Basin contains the highest diversity of riverine fishes, yet it is unclear how this fauna was assembled. To address this, and the diversification dynamics of a continental radiation, we focus on African Mastacembelus spiny eels.
Location: Afrotropical freshwaters.
Methods: The most complete molecular phylogeny to date was reconstructed for African spiny eels. Divergence times were estimated applying a Bayesian relaxed clock comparing fossil and geological calibrations across nuclear and mitochondrial trees. Biogeographic reconstructions, applying a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model and lineage diversification dynamics were examined.
Results: Spiny eels originated in Asia and colonized Africa c. 15.4 Ma (95% HPD: 23.9–8.8 Ma) from which their subsequent radiation across the Afrotropics was best fitted by a constant rate model. Ancestral state estimation identified multiple colonization events into the Congo Basin, whereas all other regions were likely to have been colonized once indicating considerable geographic constraints. Application of the fossil calibration gave similar age estimates across datasets, whereas a geological calibration estimated considerably older nuclear divergences.
Main conclusions: Despite profound environmental events during the evolutionary history of the group, there is no evidence for rapid lineage diversification. This finding supports several recent studies on tropical continental radiations that contrast to the common pattern of density-dependent diversification. We further show that dispersal has occurred into, as well as out of the Congo Basin, indicating the importance of this region in the generation of biodiversity.",10.5061/dryad.1jq96,biogeography|continental radiation|dispersal|molecular dating|diversification dynamics,Department of Genetics|Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Genomics|Department of Life Sciences|Evolution and Environment|University College London|Alabama Museum of Natural History|Department of Ichthyology|The University of Alabama|The Natural History Museum|University of Bern|American Museum of Natural History|KU Leuven|Royal Museum for Central Africa|Institute of Ecology and Evolution|South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity|Naturhistorisches Museum der Burgergemeinde,Mastacembelus|Mastacembelidae,,2017-06-12,DRYAD,Data from: Multiple independent colonizations into the Congo Basin during the continental radiation of African Mastacembelus spiny eels,,

Next to reliable parameter estimation of intrinsic physical quantities such as neutrino masses and mixing angles, these transition amplitudes are important in hypothesis testing of potential extensions of the standard model of elementary particle physics, such as additional neutrino flavors. Hence, fast yet precise implementations are of high importance to research. In the recent past, massively parallel accelerators such as CUDA-enabled GPUs featuring thousands of compute units have been widely adopted due to their superior memory bandwidth, vast compute capability, and highly competitive compute-to-energy ratio in comparison to traditional multi-core architectures with a few tens of monolithic cores. In this paper, we introduce two scalable multi-GPU extensions of common neutrino oscillation frameworks –namely Prob3++ and SQuIDS –allowing for the acceleration of oscillation dynamics computation by one to three orders-of-magnitude while preserving numerical accuracy.

Their large-scale distribution patterns nevertheless remain obscure due to insufficient data, consequently limiting biogeographical interpretations. We provide extensive new data with high resolution distribution maps, thus improving the knowledge of the ranges of these taxa. Gammarus species display substantial altitudinal variability and patchy, fragmented distribution patterns. They occur abundantly, particularly in springs and streams, from lowlands to sub-mountainous and mountainous regions. In the light of recent molecular research, we hypothesize that the complex geomorphological dynamics of the Carpathian region during the Late Tertiary probably contributed to their allopatric distribution pattern. Contrasting with Gammarus, the genera Niphargus and Synurella exhibit low altitudinal variability, broad ecological valences and overlapping distributions, being widespread throughout the lowlands.

dynamics that are still not well understood. While prior computational models of
cytoskeletal dynamics have lead to many conceptual insights, an important niche still
needs to be filled with a high-resolution structural modeling framework, which includes
a minimally-complete set of cytoskeletal chemistries, stochastically treats reaction and
diffusion processes in three spatial dimensions, accurately and efficiently describes mechanical
deformations of the filamentous network under stresses generated by molecular
motors, and deeply couples mechanics and chemistry at high spatial resolution. To
address this need, we propose a novel reactive coarse-grained force field, as well as a
publicly available software package, named the Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active
Networks (MEDYAN) , for simulating active network evolution and dynamics (available at
www.medyan.org). This model can be used to study the non-linear, far from equilibrium
processes in active matter systems, in particular, comprised of interacting semi-flexible
polymers embedded in a solution with complex reaction-diffusion processes. In this work,
we applied MEDYAN to investigate a contractile actomyosin network consisting of actin
filaments, alpha-actinin cross-linking proteins, and non-muscle myosin IIA mini-filaments.
We found that these systems undergo a switch-like transition in simulations from a random
network to ordered, bundled structures when cross-linker concentration is increased
above a threshold value, inducing contraction driven by myosin II mini-filaments. Our
simulations also show how myosin II mini-filaments, in tandem with cross-linkers, can
produce a range of actin filament polarity distributions and alignment, which is crucially
dependent on the rate of actin filament turnover and the actin filament's resulting
super-diffusive behavior in the actomyosin-cross-linker system. We discuss the biological
implications of these findings for the arc formation in lamellipodium-to-lamellum architectural
remodeling. Lastly, our simulations produce force-dependent accumulation of
myosin II, which is thought to be responsible for their mechanosensation ability, also

Within the Afrotropics, the Congo Basin contains the highest diversity of riverine fishes, yet it is unclear how this fauna was assembled. To address this, and the diversification dynamics of a continental radiation, we focus on African Mastacembelus spiny eels.
Location: Afrotropical freshwaters.
Methods: The most complete molecular phylogeny to date was reconstructed for African spiny eels. Divergence times were estimated applying a Bayesian relaxed clock comparing fossil and geological calibrations across nuclear and mitochondrial trees. Biogeographic reconstructions, applying a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model and lineage diversification dynamics were examined.
Results: Spiny eels originated in Asia and colonized Africa c. 15.4 Ma (95% HPD: 23.9–8.8 Ma) from which their subsequent radiation across the Afrotropics was best fitted by a constant rate model. Ancestral state estimation identified multiple colonization events into the Congo Basin, whereas all other regions were likely to have been colonized once indicating considerable geographic constraints. Application of the fossil calibration gave similar age estimates across datasets, whereas a geological calibration estimated considerably older nuclear divergences.
Main conclusions: Despite profound environmental events during the evolutionary history of the group, there is no evidence for rapid lineage diversification. This finding supports several recent studies on tropical continental radiations that contrast to the common pattern of density-dependent diversification.

Abstract

Molecular analysis revealed diel rhythmicity in the metabolic activity of single-celled microbial eukaryotes (protists) at station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Diel trends among different protistan taxonomic groups reflected distinct nutritional capabilities and temporal niche partitioning. Changes in relative metabolic activities among phototrophs corresponded to the light cycle, generally peaking in mid- to late-afternoon. Metabolic activities of protistan taxa with phagotrophic ability were higher at night, relative to daytime, potentially in response to increased availability of picocyanobacterial prey. Tightly correlated Operational Taxonomic Units throughout the diel cycle implicated the existence of parasitic and mutualistic relationships within the microbial eukaryotic community, underscoring the need to define and include these symbiotic interactions in marine food web descriptions. This study provided a new high-resolution view into the ecologically important interactions among primary producers and consumers that mediate the transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels. Characterizations of the temporal dynamics of protistan activities contribute knowledge for predicting how these microorganisms respond to environmental forcing factors.

However, reduced complexity of island communities can also present ecological opportunities.  For example, amphibian diversity on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is generally lower than in the Philippines, but this island supports a surprisingly diverse endemic assemblage of Sulawesi fanged frogs (genus Limnonectes).  To explore evolutionary dynamics of this system, we examined molecular, morphological, and geographical variation of fanged frogs from these two regions.  Using genealogical concordance – a conservative standard – we identified 12 species on Sulawesi, only four of which are described.   One more species can be distinguished with morphology, and a Bayesian approach to species delimitation suggests our total species estimate on Sulawesi (n = 13) is still an underestimate.   After accounting for evolutionary history, a model with multiple body size optima in sympatric Limnonectes species is significantly preferred over a “random walk” model where body size evolves by Brownian motion.  Additionally, morphological variation is higher among sympatric than non-sympatric species on Sulawesi, but not in the Philippines.  Taken together, these findings suggest that adaptive radiation of fanged frogs on Sulawesi was driven by natural selection to infiltrate ecological niches occupied by other lineages in the Philippines.  Our study supports the concept of ecological opportunity in community assembly: diversification in mature communities, such as the Philippines, is limited by a dearth of unoccupied ecological niches.  On Sulawesi however, evolutionary novelties originated in a predictable and replicated fashion in response to opportunities presented by a depauperate ancestral community.",10.5061/dryad.8913,Species diversity|Anurans (frogs and toads)|Biogeography|Biodiversity|Island|Species richness|Adaptation,Center for Environmental Genomics|FMIPA (Fakultas Matematika dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam)|McMaster University|Institut Teknologi Bandung|University of Kansas|University of California|University of Indonesia|Museum of Vertebrate Zoology|Biodiversity Research Center|School of Life Sciences and Technology|Department of Biology|Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Natural History Museum|Wildlife Conservation Society Indonesia Program,Limnonectes,,2011-03-24,DRYAD,Data from: Adaptive radiation and ecological opportunity in Sulawesi and Philippine fanged frog (Limnonectes) communities.,,

 Quantum impurity models describe an atom or molecule embedded in a host material with which it can exchange electrons. They are basic to nanoscience as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors and play an increasingly important role in the theory of ""correlated electron"" materials as auxiliary problems whose solution gives the ""dynamical mean field"" approximation to the self energy and local correlation functions.

Because the insertion of TEs in new genomic positions is largely deleterious, the molecular mechanisms for transcriptional suppression have been extensively studied. In contrast, very little is known about their primary transcriptional regulation. Here, we characterize the expression dynamics of TE families in Drosophila melanogaster across a broad temperature range (13–29°C). In 71% of the expressed TE families, the expression is modulated by temperature. We show that this temperature-dependent regulation is specific for TE families and strongly affected by the genetic background. We deduce that TEs carry family-specific regulatory sequences, which are targeted by host-specific trans-acting factors, such as transcription factors. Consistent with the widespread dominant inheritance of gene expression, we also find the prevailing dominance of TE family expression.

However, the factors influencing potato aphid dynamics and susceptibility to natural enemies are largely undescribed, particularly in relation to facultative endosymbiotic bacteria, which can provide protection against parasitism and disease in some aphid species. This study investigated whether potato aphid susceptibility to one of its principal natural enemies, the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), varied in relation to aphid genotype and/or endosymbiont presence. Parasitism and aphid fitness assays were conducted on clonal lineages of aphids, harbouring their natural endosymbiont infections, collected over 3 years from separate geographic locations. Parasitized aphids were dissected to quantify parasitoid oviposition, larval development, and mummification. Amongst the 19 clonal lines of M. euphorbiae tested, seven aphid genotypes were identified, and 11 lines harboured one or both of the facultative endosymbionts Hamiltonella defensa Moran et al. and Regiella insecticola Moran et al.; H. defensa infections were associated exclusively with two of the seven M. euphorbiae genotypes. Parasitism resistance was detected in clonal lines belonging to a single aphid genotype and resulted from failure of parasitoid eggs to develop into larvae rather than failure of the parasitoid to oviposit. Contrary with studies of several other aphid species, there was little evidence that H. defensa provided strong protection to M. euphorbiae from parasitism by A. ervi. Furthermore, there were no clear fitness costs to the aphid associated with parasitism resistance or with H. defensa infection. The two M. euphorbiae genotypes in which H. defensa occurred, which included the resistant genotype, exhibited faster development, higher survival, and greater fecundity than the other five aphid genotypes. These findings suggest that biological control of M. euphorbiae using A. ervi alone could exacerbate pest problems by selecting for the fittest parasitism-resistant genotypes.",10.5061/dryad.0t667,facultative endosymbionts|potato aphid|parasitism resistance|biocontrol,The James Hutton Institute|University of Dundee|School of the Environment,Macrosiphum euphorbiae|Hamiltonella defensa|Aphididae|Aphidius ervi|Hymenoptera|Braconidae|Hemiptera,,2016-12-27,DRYAD,Data from: Susceptibility of Macrosiphum euphorbiae to the parasitoid Aphidius ervi: larval development depends on host aphid genotype,,

The UM is a general circulation model (GCM) that solves the deep, nonhydrostatic equations of motion and uses a flexible and accurate radiative transfer scheme, based on the two-stream and correlated-k approximations, to calculate the heating rates. In this work we consistently couple a well-tested Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to solve for the chemical equilibrium abundances locally in each grid cell for a general set of elemental abundances, further improving the flexibility and accuracy of the model. As the metallicity of the atmosphere is increased we find significant changes in the dynamical and thermal structure, with subsequent implications for the simulated phase curve. The trends that we find are qualitatively consistent with previous works, though with quantitative differences. We investigate in detail the effect of increasing the metallicity by splitting the mechanism into constituents, involving the mean molecular weight, the heat capacity and the opacities.

Therefore, values in the range  with steps equal to 0.25 may be accounted for. The atoms labelled R or S can have negative and positive values assigned (e.g. −3 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom, or vice versa), opposed values (e.g. −3 for an R atom and 3 for an S atom, or vice versa), positive values (e.g. 3 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom) or negative values (e.g. −3 for an R atom and −1 for an S atom). These proposed Chiral QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs are real numbers, non-symmetric and reduced to ‘classical’ (non-chiral) QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs when symmetry is not codified (correction factor equal to zero). In this report, only the factors with opposed values were considered with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of this proposal. From QSAR modelling carried out on four chemical datasets (Cramer’s steroids, fenoterol stereoisomer derivatives, N-alkylated 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-piperidines, and perindoprilat stereoisomers), it was demonstrated that the use of several correction factors contributes to the building of models with greater robustness and predictive ability than those reported in the literature, as well as with respect to the models exclusively developed with QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs based on the factor 1 | −1.

The theoretical dependence of the shape of optical bands for the dye monomers in the vinylogous series in line with a change in the solvent polarity is considered. A simple physical (analytical) model of the shape of optical absorption bands in H-aggregates of polymethine dyes is developed based on taking the dozy-chaos dynamics of the transient state and the Frenkel exciton effect in the theory of molecular quantum transitions into account. As an example, the details of the experimental shape of one of the known H-bands are well reproduced by this analytical model under the assumption that the main optical chromophore of H-aggregates is a tetramer resulting from the two most probable processes of inelastic binary collisions in sequence: first, monomers between themselves, and then, between the resulting dimers. The obtained results indicate that in contrast with the compact structure of J-aggregates (brickwork structure), the structure of H-aggregates is not the compact pack-of-cards structure, as stated in the literature, but a loose alternate structure. Based on this theoretical model, a simple general (analytical) method for treating the more complex shapes of optical bands in polymethine dyes in comparison with the H-band under consideration is proposed. This method mirrors the physical process of molecular aggregates forming in liquid solutions: aggregates are generated in the most probable processes of inelastic multiple binary collisions between polymethine species generally differing in complexity. The results obtained are given against a background of the theoretical results on the shape of optical bands in polymethine dyes and their aggregates (dimers, H*- and J-aggregates) previously obtained by V.V.E.",10.5061/dryad.t0r3p,polymethine dyes|dozy-chaos theory|molecular aggregates|molecular quantum transitions|optical band shapes|transient state dynamics,Russian Academy of Sciences|Photochemistry Center,,,2017-04-27,DRYAD,"Data from: Nature of the optical band shapes in polymethine dyes and H-aggregates: dozy chaos and excitons.

Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty-four lesions in 103 patients (mean age: 57±14 years) were evaluated by MR DKI performed with 7 b-values of 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 s/mm2 and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging. Breast lesions were histologically characterized and DKI related parameters—mean diffusivity (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK)—were measured. The MD and MK in normal fibroglandular breast tissue, benign and malignant lesions were compared by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparison test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of MD and MK in the diagnosis of breast lesions. Results: The benign lesions (n = 42) and malignant lesions (n = 82) had mean diameters of 11.4±3.4 mm and 35.8±20.1 mm, respectively. The MK for malignant lesions (0.88±0.17) was significantly higher than that for benign lesions (0.47±0.14) (P&lt;0.001), and, in contrast, MD for benign lesions (1.97±0.35 (10−3 mm2/s)) was higher than that for malignant lesions (1.20±0.31 (10−3 mm2/s)) (P&lt;0.001). At a cutoff MD/MK 1.58 (10−3 mm2/s)/0.69, sensitivity and specificity of MD/MK for the diagnosis of malignant were 79.3%/84.2% and 92.9%/92.9%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.86/0.92 for MD/MK.

Rodríguez-León,https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.5208748,DATASET,,"A novel mathematical procedure to codify chiral features of organic molecules in the QuBiLS-MIDAS framework is introduced. This procedure constitutes a generalization to that commonly used to date, where the values 1 and −1 (correction factor) are employed to weight the molecular vectors when each atom is labelled as R (rectus) or S (sinister) according to the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rules. Therefore, values in the range  with steps equal to 0.25 may be accounted for. The atoms labelled R or S can have negative and positive values assigned (e.g. −3 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom, or vice versa), opposed values (e.g. −3 for an R atom and 3 for an S atom, or vice versa), positive values (e.g. 3 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom) or negative values (e.g. −3 for an R atom and −1 for an S atom). These proposed Chiral QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs are real numbers, non-symmetric and reduced to ‘classical’ (non-chiral) QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs when symmetry is not codified (correction factor equal to zero). In this report, only the factors with opposed values were considered with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of this proposal. From QSAR modelling carried out on four chemical datasets (Cramer’s steroids, fenoterol stereoisomer derivatives, N-alkylated 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-piperidines, and perindoprilat stereoisomers), it was demonstrated that the use of several correction factors contributes to the building of models with greater robustness and predictive ability than those reported in the literature, as well as with respect to the models exclusively developed with QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs based on the factor 1 | −1. In conclusion, it can be stated that this novel strategy constitutes a suitable alternative to computed chirality-based descriptors, contributing to the development of good models to predict properties depending on symmetry.",10.6084/m9.figshare.5208748,Biotechnology|Molecular Biology|19999 Mathematical Sciences not elsewhere classified|Genetics|39999 Chemical Sciences not elsewhere classified|Mental Health|80699 Information Systems not elsewhere classified|Computational  Biology,,,,2017-01-01,figshare.ars,Tensor algebra-based geometric methodology to codify central chirality on organic molecules,,

However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle. With unparalleled experimental control over an individual’s genotype and age, and the ability to induce reproduction and brood care, C. biroi has great potential to illuminate the molecular regulation of division of labor.",10.5061/dryad.71nv1,Reproduction|Social Evolution|Brood care|RAD-Seq|Vitellogenin,BGI-Shenzhen|Department of Biology|Centre for Social Evolution|China National Genebank|University of Copenhagen|Laboratory of Insect Social Evolution|Rockefeller University|BGI-Shenzhen|Department of Biology|Centre for Social Evolution|China National Genebank|University of Copenhagen|Laboratory of Insect Social Evolution|Rockefeller University,Apis mellifera|Camponotus floridanus|Atta cephalotes|Cerapachys biroi|Linepithema humile|Dorylomorpha|Harpegnathos saltator|Pogonomyrmex barbatus|Solenopsis invicta|Acromyrmex echinatior,,2014-02-10,DRYAD,Data from: The genome of the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi,,

The spatial distribution of plants, which is often generated by patterns of seed recruitment, is an important determinant of population dynamics, especially for orchids with seeds that must be exposed to appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. 2. We compared the distribution and abundance of target mycorrhizal fungi detected in the soil using DNA-based molecular techniques and germination in seed packets of Goodyera pubescens, Liparis liliifolia, and Tipularia discolor. 3. We further examined Tulasnella spp. associated with G. pubescens to determine whether areas with abundant host fungi resulted from multiple genets of the same species or from a single widespread fungal genet. 4. We found that target fungi were more likely to be detected using soil DNA assays than by seed germination. Based on soil DNA, fungi were more widespread than suggested by seed germination, which most often reflected the presence of abundant mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. Fungi were more likely to be abundant close to established orchids. Established plants of G. pubescens that were 50 cm apart associated with multiple fungal genets. 5. Synthesis.

The study of developmental variation has been hampered by the lack of quantitative methods for the joint analysis of embryo shape and the spatial distribution of cellular activity within the developing embryo geometry. By drawing from the strength of geometric morphometrics and pixel/voxel-based image analysis, we present a new approach for the biometric analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional embryonic images. Well-differentiated structures are described in terms of their shape, whereas structures with diffuse boundaries, such as emerging cell condensations or molecular gradients, are described as spatial patterns of intensities. We applied this approach to microscopic images of the tail fins of larval and juvenile rainbow trout. Inter-individual variation of shape and cell density was found highly spatially structured across the tail fin and temporally dynamic throughout the investigated period.",10.5061/dryad.1fq87,evo-devo|development|rainbow trout|Image Analysis|geometric morphometrics|variation,"Department of Theoretical Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna",Oncorhynchus mykiss,,2014-12-16,DRYAD,Data from: Studying developmental variation with Geometric Morphometric Image Analysis (GMIA),,

The Drosophila Y chromosome has been gradually acquiring genes from the rest of the genome, with only seven Y-linked genes being gained over the past 63 million years (0.12 gene gains per million years). Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-powered genomic scan, we show that gene transfers to the Y chromosome are much more common than previously suspected: at least 25 have arisen across three Drosophila species over the past 5.4 million years (1.67 per million years for each lineage). The gene transfer rate is significantly lower in Drosophila melanogaster than in the Drosophila simulans clade, primarily due to Y-linked retrotranspositions being significantly more common in the latter. Despite all Y-linked gene transfers being evolutionarily recent (&lt;1 million years old), only three showed evidence for purifying selection (ω ≤ 0.14). Thus, although the resulting Y-linked functional gene acquisition rate (0.25 new genes per million years) is double the longer-term estimate, the fate of most new Y-linked genes is defined by rapid degeneration and pseudogenization. Our results show that Y-linked gene traffic, and the molecular mechanisms governing these transfers, can diverge rapidly between species, revealing the Drosophila Y chromosome to be more dynamic than previously appreciated. Our analytical method provides a powerful means to identify Y-linked gene transfers and will help illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of the Y chromosome in Drosophila and other species.",10.5061/dryad.8ph59,Y chromosome|transpositions|retrocopies,,Drosophila simulans|Drosophila mauritiana|Drosophila|Drosophila melanogaster,,2017-11-02,DRYAD,Data from: High rate of translocation-based gene birth on the Drosophila Y chromosome,,

We identified 53 English language, peer-reviewed papers published between 1998 and  September 2017 for a qualitative analysis. For this analysis we registered the broad themes covered by the papers according to the ISI web categories (biodiversity and conservation, economics, environmental sciences, social sciences and marine biology). We registered the specific location of the studies, calculated the number of studies by administrative region, mapped the study sites and identified the type of ecosystem services addressed. 

For the identification of marine ecosystem services we defined ecosystem services as the benefits people obtain from coastal social-ecological systems (MA 2005) and identified the category of the ecosystem services addressed in the papers. The four ecosystem services categories that we distinguished are: supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services (MA 2005; Sukhdev 2010; Wallace 2007). The first category was defined as the supporting services which refers to the conditions, structure and functioning of coastal social-ecological systems which are required for the provision of ecosystem services. In the supporting category we identified studies dealing with the biodiversity component using species richness and habitat conditions as proxies. Provisioning services are the goods that can be extracted and consumed from marine ecosystems which are often already valued in markets, like food provision, biotic materials, biofuels and water provision (Liquete et al. 2013). Regulating services are the benefits derived from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as the water purification, coastal protection, weather regulation, biological regulation among others (Liquete et al. 2013). Cultural services are the intangible benefits that emerge from interactions between humans and nature  (Chan et al. 2012a) for instance sense of identity, spiritual value, aesthetic value and cognitive development (Liquete et al. 2013).A further description of the categories can be found elsewhere (De Groot et al. 2010; Sukhdev 2010; Wallace 2007). We synthesize the 53 studies according the provision of each one of these four ecosystem services categories in Chilean TURFs.

To aid conservation of those species, knowledge on the variability of mortality rates is essential. Unfortunately, however, individual-based multi-year data sets that are required for that have only rarely been collected for free-ranging long-lived mammals. Here, we used a five-year data set comprising activity data of 1445 RFID-tagged individuals of two long-lived temperate zone bat species, Natterer’s bats (Myotis nattereri) and Daubenton’s bats (Myotis daubentonii), at their joint hibernaculum. Both species are listed as being of high conservation interest by the European Habitats Directive. Applying mixed-effects logistic regression, we explored seasonal survival differences in these two species which differ in foraging strategy and phenology. In both species, survival over the first-winter of an individual’s life was much lower than survival over subsequent winters. Focussing on adults only, seasonal survival patterns were largely consistent with higher winter and lower summer survival but varied in its level across years in both species. Our analyses, furthermore, highlight the importance of species-specific time periods for survival. Daubenton’s bats showed a much stronger difference in survival between the two seasons than Natterer’s bats. In one exceptional winter, the population of Natterer’s bats crashed, while the survival of Daubenton’s bats declined only moderately. While, our results confirm the general seasonal survival pattern typical for hibernating mammals with higher winter than summer survival, they also show that this pattern can be reversed under particular conditions.

Background:ESCRT-III is a protein complex with the unique ability to deform cell membranes away from the cytoplasm. It plays a vital role in many important processes inside our cells such as cell division, membrane healing, budding of certain viruses (such as HIV and Ebola), formation of multi vesicular bodies and many more. The mechanism by which ESCRT-III deforms membranes is unknown.
Method:
We developed a coarse-grained biophysical model of the complex and studied its membrane deforming abilities in molecular dynamics simulations using lammps (https://lammps.sandia.gov). The aim was to identify the physical skeleton of this bio machine - the core elements that drive membrane deformation. We therefore built a pre-assembled spiral filament resembling ESCRT-III once it polymerised and had it interact with a simulated membrane.
Results:The filament consists of identical subunits that are interconnected via very strong bonds and each experience the same target curvature. The resulting target geometry of the filament would hence be a ring - however, the filament is longer and it instead grows into a spiral, which has internal tension since not all subunits can be at their desired curvature. We found that a 3 bead subunit that is interconnected to the next subunit via 9 specific bonds is required to give the filament this chiral curvature (unique direction of curvature in 3D). 
1. It was previously assumed that the inner tension due to its spiral shape (unsatisfied curvature) is what drives the filament to deform membranes. However, this would not explain why the deformations only occur away from the cytoplasm. We tested this hypothesis by placing our ESCRT-III spiral on a membrane and giving all subunits the same intrinsic curvature so that they would want to form a ring on the flat surface rather than a spiral. The result can be seen in 'Buckledepth_evolution.txt' (or Fig1 in the paper), which contains the time steps of our simulation and the corresponding buckle depth (measured by the smallest z-value of the filament at that time step). We can see that no buckle is forming despite the intrinsic tension of the spiral. So this tension can't be the driving force of the deformation.
2. &amp; 3. Instead we found that there is one essential parameter that we call the tilt angle which decides whether the spiral stays flat on the membrane or forms a helix. This angle tilts the membrane attracted surface of the spiral out of its 2D plane into a 3D cone surface. Experimental evidence suggests that different ESCRT-III protein combinations can lead to very different deformations and that the transition from a flat spiral to a helix occurs because of such structural changes within the filament (e.g. depolymerisation or co-polymerisation).We tested this by introducing a tilt angle change from 0 degrees (flat) to 60 degrees making the target geometry of our filament a tilted ring. 'Buckledepth_evolution_down.txt ' contains the time steps with corresponding buckle depth for this simulation (see Fig 2 in the paper). Now we can indeed observe a downward buckle forming. Similarly if we tilt the filament in the opposite direction (target geometry change from 0 degrees to -40 degrees) we observe a buckle forming in the opposite direction as can be seen in 'Buckleheight_evolution.txt' (see Fig. 2 in the paper).
4.We then studied the influence of the persistence length of the filament and the radius of the target geometry on the resulting buckle and found that a larger persistence length (stronger bonds between subunits) leads to more tubular (and hence deeper) deformations and a smaller radius results in narrower buckles (hence also deeper given we use the same filament length and it can form more loops in the helix). The data for this heat map is stored in Radius_persistencelength_depth.txt, which contains the target ring radius with matching persistence length and resulting buckle depth (compare to Fig.3 in the paper).
5.We also studied how the radius and tilt angle affect the forming buckle and stored this data in 'Radius_tilt_z.txt', which contains the target state radius with matching tilt angle tau and the resulting buckle depth or height. At tilt 0 we get no deformations, for positive tilt angles we get downward buckles that become more tubular with increasing angle and for negative tilt angles we get upward buckles that also become more tubular as the modulus of the angle increases.These dataset are used to generate the heatmaps in Fig 3.
6.Finally we found that a series of target geometry changes from spiral (tilt 0 degrees) to helix (tilt 60 degrees) and back to flat spiral (tilt 0 degrees) around a large cargo particle that is attracted to receptors within the membrane can lead to scission of this cargo particle. The vesicle buds off enclosed by a piece of the original membrane. 'smallcargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'smallcargo.xyz' (Fig 4.a) and 'largecargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'largecargo.xyz' (Fig 4.b). The difference is the size of the cargo particle and the percentage of receptor beads used. Both result in vesicle formation but in case b (large cargo) the filament enters an already existing membrane neck, whereas in case a (small cargo) it forms the neck itself. The simulation output files contain the x y and z coordinates of all particles within the simulation at any time step as well as the atom number, molecule id and particle type (1 membrane, 2 and 3 membrane attracted filament beads, 4 non attracted filament bead, 5 membrane receptor, 6 cargo particle).

Such alleles may also associate with population genetic footprints of recent selection, including reduced genetic diversity and inflated linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. Here, we compare the evolutionary dynamics of different balancing selection models, and characterize the evolutionary timescale and hitchhiking effects of partial selective sweeps generated under antagonistic versus nonantagonistic (e.g., overdominant and frequency-dependent selection) processes. We show that the evolutionary timescales of partial sweeps tend to be much longer, and hitchhiking effects are drastically weaker, under scenarios of antagonistic selection. These results predict an interesting mismatch between molecular population genetic and quantitative genetic patterns of variation. Balanced, antagonistically selected alleles are expected to contribute more to additive genetic variance for fitness than alleles maintained by classic, nonantagonistic mechanisms.

Web-based social and communication technologies enable citizens to self-organize relief efforts in response to crises. This work focuses on a question fundamental to the concept of collective intelligence: how effective are such self-organized channels, ungoverned by any central authority, in conforming to their intended function? In this study we examine the hashtag #PorteOuverte (""#OpenDoor"") introduced during the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, as an ""improvised logistical channel"" (ILC) to help individuals to find a safe shelter near the attack sites. We analyze the dynamics and effectiveness of #PorteOuverte by comparing its proportion of relevant logistical messages -- individuals requesting or offering shelter -- to other messages such as those offering emotional consolation or commenting on the hashtag itself.  Our results reveal that the vast majority of messages are not relevant, however the crowd senses and spreads relevant messages more than others.  We further demonstrate that relevant messages can be automatically detected and thus algorithmic promotion may be possible.

Abstract of the associated paper:
We propose a forecasting approach for solar flares based on data from Solar Cycle 24, taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. In particular, we use the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) product that facilitates cut-out magnetograms of solar active regions (AR) in the Sun in near-realtime (NRT), taken over a five-year interval (2012 - 2016).

Web-based social and communication technologies enable citizens to self-organize relief efforts in response to crises. This work focuses on a question fundamental to the concept of collective intelligence: how effective are such self-organized channels, ungoverned by any central authority, in conforming to their intended function? In this study we examine the hashtag #PorteOuverte (""#OpenDoor"") introduced during the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, as an ""improvised logistical channel"" (ILC) to help individuals to find a safe shelter near the attack sites. We analyze the dynamics and effectiveness of #PorteOuverte by comparing its proportion of relevant logistical messages -- individuals requesting or offering shelter -- to other messages such as those offering emotional consolation or commenting on the hashtag itself.  Our results reveal that the vast majority of messages are not relevant, however the crowd senses and spreads relevant messages more than others.  We further demonstrate that relevant messages can be automatically detected and thus algorithmic promotion may be possible.

Abstract of the associated paper:
We propose a forecasting approach for solar flares based on data from Solar Cycle 24, taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. In particular, we use the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) product that facilitates cut-out magnetograms of solar active regions (AR) in the Sun in near-realtime (NRT), taken over a five-year interval (2012 - 2016). Our approach utilizes a set of thirteen predictors, which are not included in the SHARP data, extracted from line-of-sight and vector photospheric magnetograms. We exploit several Machine Learning (ML) and Conventional Statistics techniques to predict flares of class &gt;M1 and &gt;C1, with a 24h forecast window. The ML methods used are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF).

CC0,"Kirschneck, Lena|Andela Saric|Baum, Buzz",https://doi.org/10.5522%2F04%2F9804494,DATASET,,"These are the data sets required to generate the figures in our paper 'Changes in ESCRT-III filament geometry drive membrane remodelling and fission in silico'.
Background:ESCRT-III is a protein complex with the unique ability to deform cell membranes away from the cytoplasm. It plays a vital role in many important processes inside our cells such as cell division, membrane healing, budding of certain viruses (such as HIV and Ebola), formation of multi vesicular bodies and many more. The mechanism by which ESCRT-III deforms membranes is unknown.
Method:
We developed a coarse-grained biophysical model of the complex and studied its membrane deforming abilities in molecular dynamics simulations using lammps (https://lammps.sandia.gov). The aim was to identify the physical skeleton of this bio machine - the core elements that drive membrane deformation. We therefore built a pre-assembled spiral filament resembling ESCRT-III once it polymerised and had it interact with a simulated membrane.
Results:The filament consists of identical subunits that are interconnected via very strong bonds and each experience the same target curvature. The resulting target geometry of the filament would hence be a ring - however, the filament is longer and it instead grows into a spiral, which has internal tension since not all subunits can be at their desired curvature. We found that a 3 bead subunit that is interconnected to the next subunit via 9 specific bonds is required to give the filament this chiral curvature (unique direction of curvature in 3D). 
1. It was previously assumed that the inner tension due to its spiral shape (unsatisfied curvature) is what drives the filament to deform membranes. However, this would not explain why the deformations only occur away from the cytoplasm. We tested this hypothesis by placing our ESCRT-III spiral on a membrane and giving all subunits the same intrinsic curvature so that they would want to form a ring on the flat surface rather than a spiral. The result can be seen in 'Buckledepth_evolution.txt' (or Fig1 in the paper), which contains the time steps of our simulation and the corresponding buckle depth (measured by the smallest z-value of the filament at that time step). We can see that no buckle is forming despite the intrinsic tension of the spiral. So this tension can't be the driving force of the deformation.
2. &amp; 3. Instead we found that there is one essential parameter that we call the tilt angle which decides whether the spiral stays flat on the membrane or forms a helix. This angle tilts the membrane attracted surface of the spiral out of its 2D plane into a 3D cone surface. Experimental evidence suggests that different ESCRT-III protein combinations can lead to very different deformations and that the transition from a flat spiral to a helix occurs because of such structural changes within the filament (e.g. depolymerisation or co-polymerisation).We tested this by introducing a tilt angle change from 0 degrees (flat) to 60 degrees making the target geometry of our filament a tilted ring. 'Buckledepth_evolution_down.txt ' contains the time steps with corresponding buckle depth for this simulation (see Fig 2 in the paper). Now we can indeed observe a downward buckle forming. Similarly if we tilt the filament in the opposite direction (target geometry change from 0 degrees to -40 degrees) we observe a buckle forming in the opposite direction as can be seen in 'Buckleheight_evolution.txt' (see Fig. 2 in the paper).
4.We then studied the influence of the persistence length of the filament and the radius of the target geometry on the resulting buckle and found that a larger persistence length (stronger bonds between subunits) leads to more tubular (and hence deeper) deformations and a smaller radius results in narrower buckles (hence also deeper given we use the same filament length and it can form more loops in the helix). The data for this heat map is stored in Radius_persistencelength_depth.txt, which contains the target ring radius with matching persistence length and resulting buckle depth (compare to Fig.3 in the paper).
5.We also studied how the radius and tilt angle affect the forming buckle and stored this data in 'Radius_tilt_z.txt', which contains the target state radius with matching tilt angle tau and the resulting buckle depth or height. At tilt 0 we get no deformations, for positive tilt angles we get downward buckles that become more tubular with increasing angle and for negative tilt angles we get upward buckles that also become more tubular as the modulus of the angle increases.These dataset are used to generate the heatmaps in Fig 3.
6.Finally we found that a series of target geometry changes from spiral (tilt 0 degrees) to helix (tilt 60 degrees) and back to flat spiral (tilt 0 degrees) around a large cargo particle that is attracted to receptors within the membrane can lead to scission of this cargo particle. The vesicle buds off enclosed by a piece of the original membrane. 'smallcargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'smallcargo.xyz' (Fig 4.a) and 'largecargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'largecargo.xyz' (Fig 4.b). The difference is the size of the cargo particle and the percentage of receptor beads used. Both result in vesicle formation but in case b (large cargo) the filament enters an already existing membrane neck, whereas in case a (small cargo) it forms the neck itself. The simulation output files contain the x y and z coordinates of all particles within the simulation at any time step as well as the atom number, molecule id and particle type (1 membrane, 2 and 3 membrane attracted filament beads, 4 non attracted filament bead, 5 membrane receptor, 6 cargo particle).

,"Shen, Chenfei",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-3625,DATASET,,"Nanomaterials have been receiving great attention in the past decade due to their wide applications in numerous areas. Among all the applications, energy storage devices and electronic/optoelectronic devices are two of the most appealing topics. During my Ph.D. study, I conduct research on the two major topics: 1. Study of novel silicon (Si) nanostructures and their application as lithium-ion battery anode materials; 2. Electronic and optoelectronic device study of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials. ❧ This dissertation starts from a brief introduction to lithium-ion battery and 2D electronics/optoelectronics in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 to 5 report the work we have done in lithium-ion battery and 2D electronics/optoelectronics. Chapter 6 discusses the future work in both Si anode direction and 2D material photodetector direction. ❧ Chapter 2 reports the study of the lithiation behaviors of both porous Si nanoparticles and porous Si nanowires by in situ and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compare them with solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires. The in situ TEM observation reveals that the critical fracture diameter of porous Si particles reaches up to 1.52 μm, which is much larger than the previously reported 150 nm for crystalline Si nanoparticles and 870 nm for amorphous Si nanoparticles. After full lithiation, solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires transform to crystalline Li₁₅Si₄ phase while porous Si nanoparticles and nanowires transform to amorphous LiₓSi phase, which is due to the effect of domain size on the stability of Li₁₅Si₄ as revealed by the first-principle molecular dynamic simulation. Ex situ TEM characterization is conducted to further investigate the structural evolution of porous and solid Si nanoparticles during the cycling process, which confirms that the porous Si nanoparticles exhibit better capability to suppress pore evolution than solid Si nanoparticles. The investigation of structural evolution and phase transition of porous Si nanoparticles and nanowires during the lithiation process reveal that they are more desirable as lithium-ion battery anode materials than solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires. ❧ Chapter 3 reports our study on Si-S full cells. The challenges in the Si S full cell integration is discussed, and a failure mechanism of Si S full cell is proposed, which is due to the spontaneous reaction between Si (and lithiated Si) and polysulfides. On this basis, we report one prototype of Si S full cells using lithiated Nafion coated porous Si as anode and sulfur as cathode, and our study on the functionality of Nafion in shielding Si from reaction with polysulfides. With optimized mass ratio between sulfur and silicon, the full cell yields specific capacity of 330 mAh/g and energy density of 590 Wh/kg after 100 cycles based on the total mass of sulfur and silicon. The achieved energy density is more than 2 times higher than commercially available lithium ion batteries. The investigation of issues in Si S full cell research and the proposed full cell prototype will shed light on the development of next generation lithium ion batteries. ❧ Chapter 4 reports the synthesis of low-cost hierarchical carbon-coated (HCC) Si using ball-milled Si as the starting material. The obtained particles prepared from different Si sources all show excellent cycling performance of over 1000 mAh/g after 1000 cycles. Interestingly, we observed in situ formation of porous Si and it is well confined in the carbon shell based on post-cycling characterization of the hierarchical carbon-coated metallurgical Si (HCC-M-Si) particles. In addition, lightweight and free-standing electrodes consisting of the HCC-M-Si particles and carbon nanofibers were fabricated, which achieved 1015 mAh/g after 100 cycles based on the total mass of the electrodes. Compared with conventional electrodes, the lightweight and free-standing electrodes significantly improve the energy density by 745%. Furthermore, LiCoO₂ and LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cathodes were used to pair up with the HCC-M-Si anode to fabricate full cells. With LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ as cathode, energy density up to 547 Wh/kg was achieved by the high-voltage full cell. After 100 cycles, the full cell with LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cathode delivers 46% more energy density than that of the full cell with LiCoO₂ cathode. The systematic investigation on low-cost Si anodes together with their applications in lightweight free-standing electrodes and high-voltage full cells will shed light on development of high-energy Si-based lithium-ion batteries for real applications. ❧ Chapter 5 studies the novel 2D material black arsenic phosphorus (b-AsₓP₁₋ₓ) formed by introducing arsenic into black phosphorus, which can significantly extend the operational wavelength range of photonic devices. The as-fabricated b-AsₓP₁₋ₓ photodetector sandwiched within hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) shows peak extrinsic responsivity of 190, 16, and 1.2 mA/W at 3.4, 5.0, and 7.7 μm at room temperature, respectively. Moreover, the intrinsic photoconductive effect dominates the photocurrent generation mechanism due to the preservation of pristine properties of b-AsₓP₁₋ₓ by complete hBN encapsulation and these b-AsₓP₁₋ₓ photodetectors exhibit negligible transport hysteresis. The broad and large photo-responsivity within mid-infrared resulting from the intrinsic photoconduction, together with the excellent long-term air stability, makes black arsenic phosphorus a promising alternative material for mid-infrared applications, such as free space communication, infrared imaging, and biomedical sensing. ❧ Chapter 6 proposes future research topics. To avoid the capacity loss of Si-based lithium-ion batteries in the first lithiation process, synthesis of LiₓSi is highly desired. We propose a one-step large-scale synthesis method of LiₓSi, which produces LiₓSi and electrode slurry in a single step. Another research topic is Te photodetector. The application of black phosphorus and black arsenic phosphorus photodetector is limited because they are air-sensitive. As an air-stable two-dimensional material, Te also possesses similar electronic/optoelectronic properties as black phosphorus, which makes it promising candidate as medium-wavelength infrared photodetector. A systematic study of Te photodetector has been conducted and the underlying photocurrent generation mechanism is under investigation.",10.25549/usctheses-c89-3625,"Materials Science|silicon, anode, full cell, two-dimensional materials, electronics, photodetector|lithium-ion battery",,,,2018-01-01,usc.dl,Nanomaterials for energy storage devices and electronic/optoelectronic devices,,

Out of 16 derivatives, five (B1, B5, B6, B9, and B13) demonstrated a significant radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. B6, which possessed two electron-donating hydroxyl groups, was most active among all. Molecular docking and MD simulation of the complex of B6 with prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) or cyclooxygenase (COX) showed that B6 occupied celecoxib binding site in COX with high affinity (the binding free energy of the complex with COX-1 was –10.5, and –11.2 kcal/mol with COX-2). Maximum anti-inflammatory activity was also shown by the B6 derivative in vivo, in the rat model of carrageenan-induced inflammation. B6, along with four other derivatives (B1, B5, B9 and B13) exhibited 80–90% free radical scavenging activity. The IC50 values of these compounds were ≥40 µM.

However, the limitation of PLA is the stiffness and brittleness. In this research, the authors had tried to improve the toughness of PLA blown film by adding carboxylated epoxidised natural rubber (ENR-COOH) as toughening agent. Epoxidised natural rubber (ENR) samples of various epoxidation level were synthesized and modified with thioglycolic acid (TGA) to yield ENR-COOH with 1, 4, 8 and 37% conversion of its initial NR, respectively, confirmed by Fourier Transforms Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H NMR). Then, blown films of ENRs-COOH/PLA compared with neat PLA film were studied to find the optimum type and rubber content. The results from Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) showed that thermal and thermomechanical properties dropped with increasing of polarity of ENRs-COOH. Compared with neat PLA film, 3 wt% ENR6-COOH/PLA films exhibited the highest elongation at break (which was approximately 9.98 times in Machine Direction (MD).

Mesic tropical ecosystems were progressively restricted to the coasts and replaced by arid-adapted floral and faunal communities. Whilst the role of aridification has been investigated in a wide range of terrestrial lineages, the response of freshwater clades remains poorly investigated. To gain insights into the diversification processes underlying a freshwater radiation, we studied the evolutionary history of the Australasian predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Hydroporini (147 described species). We used an integrative approach including the latest methods in phylogenetics, divergence time estimation, ancestral character state reconstruction, and likelihood-based methods of diversification rate estimation. Phylogenies and dating analyses were reconstructed with molecular data from seven genes (mitochondrial and nuclear) for 117 species (plus 12 outgroups). Robust and well-resolved phylogenies indicate a late Oligocene origin of Australasian Hydroporini. Biogeographic analyses suggest an origin in the East Coast region of Australia, and a dynamic biogeographic scenario implying dispersal events. The group successfully colonized the tropical coastal regions carved by a rampant desertification, and also colonized groundwater ecosystems in Central Australia. Diversification rate analyses suggest that the ongoing aridification of Australia initiated in the Miocene contributed to a major wave of extinctions since the late Pliocene probably attributable to an increasing aridity, range contractions and seasonally disruptions resulting from Quaternary climatic changes. When comparing subterranean and epigean genera, our results show that contrasting mechanisms drove their diversification and therefore current diversity pattern. The Australasian Hydroporini radiation reflects a combination of processes that promoted both diversification, resulting from new ecological opportunities driven by initial aridification, and a subsequent loss of mesic adapted diversity due to increasing aridity.",10.5061/dryad.c5g23,,,Hydroporini,,2014-07-18,DRYAD,Data from: Unveiling the diversification dynamics of Australasian predaceous diving beetles in the Cenozoic,,

,"Knott, Simon Robert Vincent",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3931,DATASET,,"Restricted until 09 Nov. 2011. For cells to proliferate, the genome must be replicated exactly once per cell cycle in a timely and accurate manner. Making this task difficult are multiple other genomic processes, such as transcription and DNA repair, that are concurrently operating on the same genomic template. Replication initiates at specific loci called replication origins that must undergo a series of protein loadings before they can begin to replicate. Although this loading schedule takes place at all origins, individual origins fire at distinct and conserved times during S-phase.   It has been suggested that origin firing schedules are defined by their propensity to attract rate limiting replication factors from limited pools (where origins with higher propensities replicate earlier and origins with lower propensities replicate later). This model has not been validated and, furthermore, the factors determining an origin's propensity to attract replication factors remains poorly understood. In higher eukaryotes, replication timing has been linked to epigenetic inheritance and genomic stability. Thus, determining which factors dictate origin timing schedules is important for understanding the mechanisms driving development and healthy cell proliferation.; This current work investigates the molecular kinetics that drive the S. cerevisiae replication schedule and also begins to uncover what coordination they exhibit with concurrently operating genomic processes. To understand better these timing dynamics, we begin by developing molecular and computational tools to analyze replication timing genome-wide. Using these tools we produce a novel dataset that represents the highest fidelity temporal map of DNA replication to date. Next, to identify novel candidate limiting factors to DNA replication, we describe and analyze (in the context of this temporal map) two additional datasets designed to capture both pre-S-phase replication protein loading and global origin efficiencies.; Through analysis of these data we determine that, in G1-phase, the earliest replicating origins show a high propensity to attract Cdc45 (a replication factor that is limited in its nuclear concentration G1-phase). Following this, we devise and computationally implement a detailed theoretical model of DNA replication to test the hypothesis that origin firing dynamics (and hence genome-wide replication times) are determined by their ability to recruit replication factors from limited pools. After validating this model we identify factors that, in unperturbed cells, are correlated with origin firing dynamics. These include nucleosome positioning around the origin and the clustering of origins in the nucleus in late G1-phase.; Previous work has demonstrated that histone acetylation around an origin promotes its early replication. Specifically, others have shown that when the histone-deacetylase Rpd3 is removed from the cell several origins increase in their activity. To test the scope of Rpd3's action at origins, we have analyzed Rpd3 mutant cells genome-wide for their origin replication activities. We determined that approximately one-third of origins are suppressed by Rpd3 action. By targeting the individual complexes that Rpd3 operates in, we determined that its action at origins is through its role in transcriptional repression at the gene promoter, as opposed to its broad action as a suppressor of spurious transcription events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regions surrounding Rpd3-regulated origns are deacetylated by Rpd3 and also that these regions are enriched for Rpd3 binding and Rpd3-regulated genes.; Finally, we introduce the forkhead transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 as two novel regulators of origin function. We demonstrate that Fkh1 alone regulates ~50 origins and that in cells where both Fkh1 and Fkh2 action is removed, over one-half of all origins show deregulation. Furthermore, these factors are the first to be identified that have both repressive and excitatory action at origins (~100 origins are activated by Fkh1 and Fkh2 while ~80 are repressed; Fkh-excited and -repressed, respectively). As mentioned above, Cdc45 association at origins in G1-phase is predictive of their function. We demonstrate that in fkh1Δfkh2Δ cells, this factor is depleted at Fkh-excited origins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Fkh-excited origins are not found near the centromere, in contrast Fkh-repressed origins include many origins that localize at the centromere. Finally, we determine that Fkh1 and Fkh2 likely have their action at origins by regulating the formation of long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show evidence suggesting (that to regulate these interactions) individual forkhead proteins bind at different origins and then dimerize to bring these origins together in the nucleus.",10.25549/usctheses-m3931,modeling|transcription|Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|replication origin|chromatin,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,"Measuring, modeling and identifying factors that influence eukaryotic DNA replication",,

OsMDHAR-expressing yeast cells displayed enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide by maintaining redox homoeostasis, proteostasis, and the ascorbate (AsA)-like pool following the accumulation of antioxidant enzymes and molecules, metabolic enzymes, and molecular chaperones and their cofactors, compared to wild-type (WT) cells carrying vector alone. The addition of exogenous AsA or its analogue isoascorbic acid increased the viability of WT and ara2Δ cells under oxidative stress. Furthermore, the survival of OsMDHAR-expressing cells was greater than that of WT cells when cells at mid-log growth phase were exposed to high concentrations of ethanol. High OsMDHAR expression also improved the fermentative capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a standard cultivation temperature (30°C). The alcohol yield of OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast during fermentation was approximately 25% (0.18 g·g-1) higher than that of WT yeast. Accordingly, OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast showed prolonged survival during the environmental stresses produced during fermentation.

Mesic tropical ecosystems were progressively restricted to the coasts and replaced by arid-adapted floral and faunal communities. Whilst the role of aridification has been investigated in a wide range of terrestrial lineages, the response of freshwater clades remains poorly investigated. To gain insights into the diversification processes underlying a freshwater radiation, we studied the evolutionary history of the Australasian predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Hydroporini (147 described species). We used an integrative approach including the latest methods in phylogenetics, divergence time estimation, ancestral character state reconstruction, and likelihood-based methods of diversification rate estimation. Phylogenies and dating analyses were reconstructed with molecular data from seven genes (mitochondrial and nuclear) for 117 species (plus 12 outgroups). Robust and well-resolved phylogenies indicate a late Oligocene origin of Australasian Hydroporini. Biogeographic analyses suggest an origin in the East Coast region of Australia, and a dynamic biogeographic scenario implying dispersal events. The group successfully colonized the tropical coastal regions carved by a rampant desertification, and also colonized groundwater ecosystems in Central Australia. Diversification rate analyses suggest that the ongoing aridification of Australia initiated in the Miocene contributed to a major wave of extinctions since the late Pliocene probably attributable to an increasing aridity, range contractions and seasonally disruptions resulting from Quaternary climatic changes. When comparing subterranean and epigean genera, our results show that contrasting mechanisms drove their diversification and therefore current diversity pattern. The Australasian Hydroporini radiation reflects a combination of processes that promoted both diversification, resulting from new ecological opportunities driven by initial aridification, and a subsequent loss of mesic adapted diversity due to increasing aridity.",10.5061/dryad.c5g23,,,Hydroporini,,2014-07-18,DRYAD,Data from: Unveiling the diversification dynamics of Australasian predaceous diving beetles in the Cenozoic,,

Our objectives were to test an earlier hypothesis of multiple introductions of this species to the Northeastern US, and evaluate putative temporal changes in genetic makeup.  Using a panel of seven microsatellite loci, we confirmed the existence of two abundant genetic forms in specimens originally collected in 1999-2000 (FST value based on microsatellite data = 0.26) that matches the disjunctive distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes. To examine the distribution of the two genetic â  typesâ   across Pennsylvania we created a fine-scale genetic map of Ae. japonicus using 439 specimens collected from 54 Pennsylvania counties in 2002-03. We also made direct comparisons between collections in 1999-2000 and new collections made in 2004-2005 obtained from the same areas in the northeastern US. We observed that the strong association between mtDNA haplotype and microsatellite signature seen in 1999-2000 had weakened significantly by 2002 across Pennsylvania, a trend continued to some extent in 2004-2005 in PA, NJ, and NY, indicating that once easily distinguishable separate introductions are merging. The two expanding genetic forms create a complex correlation between spatial and genetic distances. The existence of multiple introductions would be obscured without sampling early and across time with highly polymorphic molecular markers. Our results provide a high-resolution analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of a newly introduced disease vector and argue that successive introductions may be a common pattern for invasive mosquitoes.",10.5061/dryad.1122,Phylogeography|Invasive Species|Population Genetics - Empirical,,Aedes japonicus,,2009-12-07,DRYAD,"Data from: Fine-scale spatial and temporal population genetics of Aedes japonicus, a new US mosquito, reveal multiple introductions",,

Abstract
from research paper:


Background

Many patients
with neuropathic pain present without signs of nerve injury on routine clinical
examination. Some of these patients may have inflamed peripheral nerves
(neuritis). In this study, we have examined whether neuritis causes changes
within the dorsal horn that may contribute to a central pain mechanism.
Comparisons have been made to a model of axonal transport disruption induced
using vinblastine, since neuritis disrupts such processes.


Results

At the peak of
cutaneous hypersensitivities, recordings from wide dynamic range neurons
revealed increases in wind-up following neuritis but not vinblastine treatment.
Ongoing activity from these neurons was unchanged. Vinblastine treatment caused
a reduction in the responses of wide dynamic range neurons to noxious
mechanical stimulation of the receptive field. The response of neurons to
innocuous mechanical stimulation was also reduced in wide dynamic range neurons
that were at a depth ≥550 µm following vinblastine treatment. An examination of
the superficial dorsal horn revealed an increase in c-Fos–positive neurons in
both groups following electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. The area of
dorsal horn expressing substance P was also decreased following vinblastine
treatment.


Conclusion

These findings
indicate that a minor nerve insult, such as neuritis, can lead to changes
within the dorsal horn that are consistent with a central neuropathic pain
mechanism.

A total of 916 unrelated healthy male individuals of Han ancestry provided blood samples with informed consent, including 207 samples from Changzhou, 147 from Xuzhou, 111 from Suqian, 98 from Wuxi, 71 from Lianyungang, 62 from Yancheng, 55 from Huai’an, 47 from Soochow, 41 from Nanjing, 39 from Nantong, 17 from Zhenjiang, 14 from Yangzhou, and 7 from Taizhou. All individuals come from Chinese Jiangsu Han population and reside locally at least three generations. Chelex-100 protocol was adopted to extract genomic DNA. The study was conducted in accordance to the human and ethical research principles of Zhongshan City People’s Hospital and approved by the ethics committee in Zhongshan City People’s Hospital.

STR genotyping
Y-STR was typed for the PowerPlex Y23 System (Promega, USA) with GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Amplified DNAs were separated on ABI3130XL DNA Genetic Analyzer  (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and analyzed using the GeneMapper ID-X software  (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Statistical analysis
After direct count of the allele frequencies and haplotype by Arlequin 3.0, we calculated gene diversity (GD) following Nei. We also calculated several representative forensic parameters, such as haplotype diversity (HD), discrimination capacity (DC), and match probability (MP) according Sabine et al. DYS385a/b, a multi-copy locus, was analyzed as combined haplotypes. And we got the allele of DYS389II by the subtraction of DYS389I. The popular combination of computational RST values which referred to the excess similarity among alleles chosen randomly within the subgroup relative to the entire group and Multidimensional Scaling plot (MDS) was adopted as YHRD analyzed and many publications conducted. Linkage patterns and Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) which generated the pairwise RST values and according significant values were performed using Arlequin 3.0 based on detailed haplotype information of eligible individuals (samples with the null, intermediate alleles, and copy-number variations were removed). Neighbor-Joining (N-J) tree was depicted and visualized by Mega 6.0 as others conducted. Based on the matrix of RST values, we illustrated MDS as YHRD recommended and achieved values of initial stress by employing “MASS” package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html).

Observed dispersal rate (DO) values were estimated from time-calibrated molecular phylogenies in Lagrange+, a modified version of the ML-based parametric biogeographic program Lagrange. DO is measured in units of ‘wallaces’ (wa) as the number of biogeographic range-expansion events per million years. DO estimates were generated on a dynamic paleogeographic landscape of five areas over three time intervals from Upper Cretaceous to Recent. Expected dispersal rate (DE) values were generated from alternative paleogeographic models, with dispersal rates proportional to target area and source-river discharge volume, and inversely proportional to paleogeographic distance. Correlations between DO and DE were used to assess the relative contributions of these three biogeographic parameters. DO estimates imply a persistent dispersal corridor across the Eastern (Antillean) margin of the Caribbean plate, under the influence of prevailing and perennial riverine discharge vectors such as the Proto-Orinoco-Amazon (POA) river. Ancestral area estimation places the earliest colonizations of the Greater Antilles and Central America (GACA) during the Paleocene-Eocene (c. 58-45 Ma), potentially during the existence of an incomplete Paleogene Arc (~59 Ma) or Lesser Antilles Arc (~45 Ma), but predating the GAARlandia land bridge (~34-33 Ma). Paleogeographic distance is the single best predictor of DO.

The method applied consists of a multiplatform system called (P). To this empty system (P), a series of applications called (A) will be added. The result of the combination of P and A will give a product that it will be called (CPx), where (x) is the application change. The fictitious product (CPx) is obtained in the medium called (M). In this way a container was selected for thermal applications in various applications such as dehydration, incubation, cell culture, refrigeration and sterilization of dry air.
To obtain the physical model it was necessary to use a container with a known volume that would allow adding sensors and maintaining a treatment space (St) for the products to be treated. Then, an important consideration was the need of a low cost system and finally any person or group, with a minimum knowledge base, could build that. For the demonstration prototype, temperature sensors were added to the actuators and to the internal and external dry air volumes, humidity sensors, pressure and electrical current.
The technique implemented is based on the digital data acquisition system, where the physical signal is acquired, converted to an electrical signal, filtered; the analog to digital conversion is carried out, and converted to text files. Three actuators were installed, which are necessary to cover the temperature ranges. This prevents an excessive use of energy, as follows:
•	Actuator (Ra) electrical heating element, connected at 220 VAC, that covers the temperature range from 60 ° C to 270 ° C.
•	Actuator (Rb) electrical heating element connected at 12 VDC, that covers the temperature range from 25 ° C to 60 ° C.
•	Actuator (Rc) Peltier module, connected at 12 VDC, that covers the temperature range from 25 ° C to -10 ° C.

The Matworks® software tools used were Simulink, Sisotools, Stateflow and Matlab to check the mathematical model, the transfer function and the PID control algorithm. Furthermore, with Simulink the transfer function response curve without the regulation of the controller parameters, and then the resulting curve compared with the values P, I, D, after setting the PID values. The Sisotools software was used as a graphical tool to analyze the linear first order system. The controller gain is then modified to change the controller overshoot.
The data flow and state diagrams were modeled using the Stateflow software in order to compare the theoretical data with the real model and validate the design concept. Finally, Matlab was used to solve the first-order differential equation.

We conducted a 4-year capture–recapture study to measure survival by genotype and phenotype in the Southwestern Fence Lizard (Sceloporus cowlesi) at the White Sands ecotone (transition area between white sands and dark soil habitats). We report several unanticipated findings. First, in contrast with previous work showing that cryptic blanched coloration in S. cowlesi from the heart of the dunes is associated with mutations in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r), ecotonal S. cowlesi showed minimal association between colour phenotype and Mc1r genotype. Second, the frequency of the derived Mc1r allele in ecotonal S. cowlesi appeared to decrease over time. Third, our capture–recapture data revealed a lower survival rate for S. cowlesi individuals with the derived Mc1r allele. Thus, our results suggest that selection at the ecotone may have favoured the wild-type allele in recent years. Even in a system where a genotype–phenotype association appeared to be black and white, our study suggests that additional factors – including phenotypic plasticity, epistasis, pleiotropy and gene flow – may play important roles at the White Sands ecotone. Our study highlights the importance of linking molecular, genomic and organismal approaches for understanding adaptation in the wild. Furthermore, our findings indicate that dynamics of natural selection can be particularly complex in transitional habitats like ecotones and emphasize the need for future research that examines the patterns of ongoing selection in other ecological ‘grey’ zones.",10.5061/dryad.f79n4,JAGS|natural selection|ecotone|capture-recapture|crypsis|Adaptation,Policy|& Management|Department of Wildlife|& Conservation Biology|Berkeley|University of California|Davis|Department of Environmental Science|Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology|Fish|Santa Cruz,Sceloporus cowlesi,,2016-10-20,DRYAD,Data from: Survival by genotype: patterns at Mc1r are not black and white at the White Sands ecotone,,

The hybridization dynamics of the Northern Flicker complex have received considerable attention, primarily due to the conspicuous plumage differences among these birds and the geographically extensive hybrid zone between the Red-shafted (Colaptes auratus cafer) and Yellow-shafted (Colaptes auratus auratus) flickers in the Great Plains region of North America. However, no traditional molecular techniques have been able to differentiate these 2 morphologically well-defined taxa from one another, or conclusively from the closely related Gilded Flicker (Colaptes chrysoides). Here, we use a next-generation sequencing approach to assess the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of these 3 taxa. We confirm the overall low levels of differentiation found using traditional molecular markers, but are able to distinguish between the 3 taxa for the first time, using a dataset of thousands of SNP loci distributed across the genome. Through demographic modeling and phylogenetic reconstructions, we find that Red-shafted and Yellow-shafted flickers are likely sister taxa, and that their divergence from the Gilded Flicker was comparatively older. The low level of divergence and lack of fixed differences in our dataset between Red-shafted and Yellow-shafted flickers, in particular, suggests whole-genome re-sequencing may be necessary to assess the dynamics of their hybridization and identify the genetic basis of their striking differences in plumage.",10.5061/dryad.4c57d0f,Northern Flicker complex|genomics|genetic structure|Gilded Flicker|RAD sequencing,,Colaptes auratus|Colaptes chrysoides,,2018-06-12,DRYAD,Data from: A flicker of hope: genomic data distinguish Northern Flicker taxa despite low levels of divergence,,

These events are dependent on calcium entering the cell: high calcium influx activates the CaMKII pathway that leads to LTP, whereas low influx triggers the calcineurin pathway that leads to LTD. The outcome of these cascades is represented by phosphorylation of AMPA receptors, prevalent feature of LTP. This model represents the aforementioned biochemical mechanisms based on calcium concentrations and it is a simplified version of Li et al (2012)* model of synaptic plasticity. Additionally, it was extended by the addition of a pathway activated by glutamate binding to mGluR5 that leads to calcium-induced calcium release, through activation of IP3 receptors. This extended version better depicts calcium dynamics in the cell. Both models can be found as SBML files and they were originally created to run in COPASI software. Simulations can be run as time courses (here of 500 sec) or parameter scans for various molecular concentrations.

Members of the P. amabilis species complex represent invaluable germplasm for the breeding program. However, the phylogeny of the P. amabilis species complex is still uncertain. The Phalaenopsis amabilis species complex (Orchidaceae) consists of subspecies amabilis, moluccana, and rosenstromii of P. amabilis, as well as P. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite, P. ap. ssp. formosana, and P. sanderiana. The aims of this study were to reconstruct the phylogeny and biogeographcial patterns of the species complex using Neighbor Joining (NJ), Maxinum Parsimony (MP), Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) and Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies (RASP) analyses based on sequences of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 from the nuclear ribosomal DNA and the trnH-psbA spacer from the plastid DNA. Results: A pattern of vicariance, dispersal, and vicariance + dispersal among disjunctly distributed taxa was uncovered based on RASP analysis.

Dorsal horn electrophysiological, behavioural and
immunohistochemical data following neuritis and vinblastine-induced axonal
transport disruption. Data set includes ongoing activity rates, wind-up and mechanical
responses from wide dynamic range neurons, numbers of c-Fos positive cells and
area of substance p labelling in the dorsal horn.



Abstract
from research paper:


Background

Many patients
with neuropathic pain present without signs of nerve injury on routine clinical
examination. Some of these patients may have inflamed peripheral nerves
(neuritis). In this study, we have examined whether neuritis causes changes
within the dorsal horn that may contribute to a central pain mechanism.
Comparisons have been made to a model of axonal transport disruption induced
using vinblastine, since neuritis disrupts such processes.


Results

At the peak of
cutaneous hypersensitivities, recordings from wide dynamic range neurons
revealed increases in wind-up following neuritis but not vinblastine treatment.
Ongoing activity from these neurons was unchanged. Vinblastine treatment caused
a reduction in the responses of wide dynamic range neurons to noxious
mechanical stimulation of the receptive field. The response of neurons to
innocuous mechanical stimulation was also reduced in wide dynamic range neurons
that were at a depth ≥550 µm following vinblastine treatment. An examination of
the superficial dorsal horn revealed an increase in c-Fos–positive neurons in
both groups following electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. The area of
dorsal horn expressing substance P was also decreased following vinblastine
treatment.


Conclusion

These findings
indicate that a minor nerve insult, such as neuritis, can lead to changes
within the dorsal horn that are consistent with a central neuropathic pain
mechanism.

Abstract:

Genomic instability pathways in colorectal cancer (CRC) have been extensively studied, but the role of retrotransposition in colorectal carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Although retrotransposons are usually repressed, they become active in several human cancers, in particular those of the gastrointestinal tract. Here we characterize retrotransposon insertions in 202 colorectal tumor whole genomes and investigate their associations with molecular and clinical characteristics. We find highly variable retrotransposon activity among tumors and identify recurrent insertions in 15 known cancer genes. In approximately 1% of the cases we identify insertions in APC, likely to be tumor-initiating events. Insertions are positively associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype and the genomic fraction of allelic imbalance. Clinically, high number of insertions is independently associated with poor disease-specific survival.

Sample description: 

A signed informed consent was obtained for as many human participants as possible. In cases without a signed informed consent, an authorization from the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Dnro 421/04/044/06, Dnro 8048/06.01.03.01/2014, Dnro 358/32/300/05, Dnro 1476/06.01.03.01/2012) was obtained as stated in Finnish law. The study has been reviewed by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital district of Helsinki and Uusima (Dnro 133/E8/03, 408/13/03/03/2009). Permission to use patient information was obtained from the National Institute for Health and Welfare (Dnro 53/07/2000, Dnro THL/1071/5.05.00/2011, Dnro THL/151/5.05.00/2017).  

RNA sequencing:

Total RNA from consecutive cryosections was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) from 34 tumors that displayed more than 50% of cancer cell percentage (HE staining of cryosections) and RNA integrity&gt;6 (Agilent RNA 6000, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina Hiseq 2000. RNA-seq data was processed using Kallisto (version 0.43.0) software. Kallisto quantification was executed in paired-end mode and aligned against the Ensembl Human reference transcriptome (GRCh37_79). Quantification results from Kallisto were normalized and aggregated to gene-level utilizing sleuth (version 0.28.1) R package with default filtering settings.

Optimization of conservation strategies for these endangered marine top predators requires direct estimates of breeding patterns and connectivity, which are essential to understand their population dynamics. While there have been some attempts to investigate breeding patterns of reef sharks from litter reconstruction using molecular analyses, direct fine-scale migrations of female sharks for parturition as well as connectivity at a medium scale, such as between islands, remain mostly unknown. We used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to determine breeding patterns of female blacktip reef sharks in Moorea (Society Islands, French Polynesia). Such an approach demonstrates that while most females gave birth at their home island, some migrated to specific nursery areas outside their home range, sometimes going to another island (up to 50 km across deep ocean). Analysis also revealed that females migrated to the same nursery on every birthing event. Many offspring showed a high level of inbreeding indicating an overall reduced population size, restricted movements and dispersal, or specific mating behaviour. Females represent the vectors that transport the genes at nursery grounds, and their fidelity should thus define reproductive units. As females seem to be philopatric, males could be the ones dispersing genes between metapopulations.

,"Yu, Hao",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-470444,DATASET,,"In this thesis, we develop new Lagrangian methods with fast convergence for constrained convex programs with complicated functional constraints. The dual subgradient method, also known as the dual ascent method, and the primal dual subgradient method, also known as the Arrow-Hurwicz-Uzawa subgradient method, are classical Lagrangian methods to solve constrained convex programs. Both methods are known to have a slow O(1∕ε²) convergence time. In contrast, the new Lagrangian methods proposed in this thesis have a faster O(1∕ε) convergence time. Recall that the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is another representative Lagrangian method for convex programs with linear equality constraints, is also known to have O(1∕ε) convergence. However, our methods work for general convex programs with possibly non-linear constraints. ❧ We first revisit the classical dual subgradient method and study its convergence time for constrained strongly convex programs in Chapter 2. By using a novel drift-plus-penalty type analysis, we show that the dual subgradient method enjoys a faster O(1∕ε) convergence time for general (possibly non-differentiable) constrained strongly convex programs. After that, we seek to develop new Lagrangian methods with the fast O(1∕ε) convergence time for general constrained convex programs without strong convexity in Chapter 3, which is the core chapter in this thesis. Based on the new Lagrangian methods developed in Chapter 3, new techniques that exceed the state-of-the-art are developed for joint rate control and routing in data networks in Chapter 4 and for online convex optimization with stochastic and long term constraints in Chapters 5-6. ❧ The other focus of this thesis is to illustrate the practical relevance of mathematical optimization techniques in engineering systems. In Chapter 7, we adapt our new online convex optimization technique to the power control for energy harvesting devices with outdated state information such that we can achieve utility within O(ε) of the optimal by using a battery with an O(1∕ε) capacity. In Chapter 8, we extend conventional drift-plus-penalty stochastic optimization and Zinkevich's online convex optimization to develop new dynamic transmit covariance design policies for MIMO fading systems with unknown channel distributions and inaccurate channel state information. In Chapter 9, we study the index coding problem and characterize the optimality of two representative scalar and fractional linear codes, i.e., cyclic codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, by studying the integrality gap between the integer linear program from an information theoretical lower bound and its linear relaxations and the Lagrangian duality between various linear relaxations and their dual problems.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-470444,constrained convex programs|optimization|Lagrangian methods|Electrical Engineering,,,,2018-01-01,usc.dl,New Lagrangian methods for constrained convex programs and their applications,,

While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an omics scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. Ensembler takes any set of sequences—from a single sequence to an entire superfamily—and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant PDB structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. Ensembler thus automates much of the time-consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics—such as Markov state models (MSMs)—which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates.

Optimization of conservation strategies for these endangered marine top predators requires direct estimates of breeding patterns and connectivity, which are essential to understand their population dynamics. While there have been some attempts to investigate breeding patterns of reef sharks from litter reconstruction using molecular analyses, direct fine-scale migrations of female sharks for parturition as well as connectivity at a medium scale, such as between islands, remain mostly unknown. We used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to determine breeding patterns of female blacktip reef sharks in Moorea (Society Islands, French Polynesia). Such an approach demonstrates that while most females gave birth at their home island, some migrated to specific nursery areas outside their home range, sometimes going to another island (up to 50 km across deep ocean). Analysis also revealed that females migrated to the same nursery on every birthing event. Many offspring showed a high level of inbreeding indicating an overall reduced population size, restricted movements and dispersal, or specific mating behaviour. Females represent the vectors that transport the genes at nursery grounds, and their fidelity should thus define reproductive units. As females seem to be philopatric, males could be the ones dispersing genes between metapopulations. These results highlight the need for conservation of coastal zones where female reef sharks seems to exhibit philopatry during the breeding season.",10.5061/dryad.gk7nh,,CRIOBE|Laboratoire d'Excellence 'Corail'|USR 3278,,,2012-10-11,DRYAD,Data from: Direct genetic evidence for reproductive philopatry and associated fine-scale migrations in female blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in French Polynesia.,,

After &gt;20 years of intensive usage, the extent of mitochondrial evolutionary rate variations across species, their practical consequences on sequence analysis methods, and the ultimate reasons for mtDNA hypermutability are still largely unresolved issues. Using an extensive cytochrome b data set, fossil data, and taking advantage of the decoupled dynamics of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, we measure the lineage-specific mitochondrial mutation rate across 1,696 mammalian species and compare it with the nuclear rate. We report an unexpected 2 orders of magnitude mitochondrial mutation rate variation between lineages: cytochrome b third codon positions are renewed every 1-2 Myr, in average, in the fastest evolving mammals, whereas it takes &gt;100 Myr in slow-evolving lineages. This result has obvious implications in the fields of molecular phylogeny, molecular dating, and population genetics. Variations of mitochondrial substitution rate across species are partly explained by body mass, longevity, and age of female sexual maturity. The classical metabolic rate and generation time hypothesis, however, do not fully explain the observed patterns, especially a stronger effect of longevity in long-lived than in short-lived species. We propose that natural selection tends to decrease the mitochondrial mutation rate in long-lived species, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of aging.",10.5061/dryad.82181,,,,,2013-02-11,DRYAD,Data from: Strong variations of mitochondrial mutation rate across mammals--the longevity hypothesis.,,

Motivated by computational convenience, this assumption sacrifices biological realism and offers little opportunity to uncover the temporal dynamics in evolutionary histories. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that explicitly relaxes the time-homogeneity assumption by allowing the specification of different infinitesimal substitution rate matrices across different time intervals, called epochs, along the evolutionary history. We focus on an epoch model implementation in a Bayesian inference framework that offers great modeling flexibility in drawing inference about any discrete data type characterized as a continuous-time Markov chain, including phylogeographic traits. To alleviate the computational burden that the additional temporal heterogeneity imposes, we adopt a massively parallel approach that achieves both fine- and coarse-grain parallelization of the computations across branches that accommodate epoch transitions, making extensive use of graphics processing units. Through synthetic examples, we assess model performance in recovering evolutionary parameters from data generated according to different evolutionary scenarios that comprise different numbers of epochs for both nucleotide and codon substitution processes. We illustrate the usefulness of our inference framework in two different applications to empirical data sets: the selection dynamics on within-host HIV populations throughout infection and the seasonality of global influenza circulation.

Samples from a 180 ft. long section of a vertical well were studied via spontaneous and forced imbibition experiments, at lab-scale, on small samples with characteristic dimensions of a few cm; in order to quantify the water imbibed by the complex multi-porosity shale system. The imbibition process is, typically, characterized by a distinct transition from an initial linear rate (vs. square root of time) to a much slower imbibition rate at later times. These observations along with contact angle measurements provide an insight into the wettability characteristics of the shale surface. Using these observations, together with an assumed geometry of the fracture system, has made it possible to estimate the distance travelled by the injected water into the formation at field scale. ❧ Shale characterization experiments including permeability measurements, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, pore size distribution (PSD) and contact angle measurements were also performed and were combined with XRD measurements in order to better understand the mass transfer properties of shale. The experimental permeabilities measured in the direction along the bedding plane (10⁻¹10⁻² mD) and in the vertical direction (~10⁻⁴ mD) are orders of magnitude higher than the matrix permeabilities of these shale sample (10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁸ mD). This implies that the fastest flow in a formation is likely to occur in the horizontal direction, and indicates that the flow of fluids through the formation occurs predominantly through the fracture and micro-fracture network, and hence that these are the main conduits for gas recovery. The permeability differences among samples from various depths can be attributed to different organic matter content and mineralogical characteristics, likely attributed to varying depositional environments. The study of these properties can help ascertain the ideal depth for well placement and perforation. ❧ Forced imbibition experiments have been carried out to better understand the phenomena that take place during well stimulation under realistic reservoir conditions. Imbibition experiments have been performed with real and simulated frac fluids, including deionized (DI) water, to establish a baseline, in order to study the impact on imbibition rates resulting from the presence of ions/additives in the imbibing fluid. Ion interactions with shales are studied using ion chromatography (IC) to ascertain their effect on imbibition induced porosity and permeability change of the samples. It has been found that divalent cations such as calcium and anions such as sulfates (for concentrations in excess of 600 ppm) can significantly reduce the permeability of the samples. It is concluded, therefore, that their presence in stimulating fluids can affect the capillarity and fluid flow after stimulation. We have also studied the impact of using fluorosurfactant additives during spontaneous and forced imbibition experiments. A number of these additives have been shown to increase the measured contact angles of the shale samples and the fluid recovery from them, thus making them an ideal candidate for additives to use. Their interactions with the shale are further characterized using the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique in order to measure their hydrodynamic radius to compare it with the pore size of the shale sample.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-215845,flowback fluids|unconventional|permeability|gas shale|fluid interaction|dual porosity|spontaneous imbibition|imbibition|Chemical Engineering|Marcellus shale|capillarity,,,,2016-01-01,usc.dl,Spontaneous countercurrent and forced imbibition in gas shales,,

Where population dynamics show negative density-dependence, suppression can be enhanced if lethality occurs after the density-dependent (i.e. larval) stage. Existing molecular tools have limited current examples of such Genetic Pest Management (GPM) systems to achieving this through engineering ‘cell-autonomous effectors’ i.e. where the expressed deleterious protein is restricted to the cells in which it is expressed – usually under the control of the regulatory elements (e.g. promoter regions) used to build the system. This limits the flexibility of these technologies as regulatory regions with useful spatial, temporal or sex-specific expression patterns may only be employed if the cells they direct expression in are simultaneously sensitive to existing effectors, and also precludes the targeting of extracellular regions such as cell-surface receptors. Expanding the toolset to ‘non-cell autonomous’ effectors would significantly reduce these limitations.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We sought to engineer female-specific, late-acting lethality through employing the Ae. aegypti VitellogeninA1 promoter to drive blood-meal-inducible, fat-body specific expression of tTAV. Initial attempts using pro-apoptotic effectors gave no evident phenotype, potentially due to the lower sensitivity of terminally-differentiated fat-body cells to programmed-death signals. Subsequently, we dissociated the temporal and spatial expression of this system by engineering a novel synthetic effector (Scorpion neurotoxin – TetO-gp67.AaHIT) designed to be secreted out of the tissue in which it was expressed (fat-body) and then affect cells elsewhere (neuro-muscular junctions). This resulted in a striking, temporary-paralysis phenotype after blood-feeding. 

Conclusions/Significance: These results are significant in demonstrating for the first time an engineered ‘action at a distance’ phenotype in a non-model pest insect. The potential to dissociate temporal and spatial expression patterns of useful endogenous regulatory elements will extend to a variety of other pest insects and effectors.",10.5061/dryad.25pp406,,,,,2019-08-05,DRYAD,Data from: Engineered action at a distance: blood-meal-inducible paralysis in Aedes aegypti,,

The plausibility of this hypothesis was tested with stochastic simulation of adaptation at the molecular sequence level in finite populations. Under the conditions of strong selection and weak mutation, the rates of allele fixation and amino acid reversion increased with population size and selection coefficients.

Nasopharyngeal carriage studies provide insight into the local prevalence of circulating pneumococcal serotypes. There are very few data on the concurrent carriage of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and serotype distribution of pneumococci carried in the nasopharynx of young healthy Nepalese children prior to the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine using a microarray-based molecular serotyping method capable of detecting multi-serotype carriage. We conducted a cross-sectional study of healthy children aged 6 weeks to 24 months from the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal between May and October 2012. Nasopharyngeal swabs were frozen and subsequently plated on selective culture media. DNA extracts of plate sweeps of pneumococcal colonies from these cultures were analysed using a molecular serotyping microarray capable of detecting relative abundance of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. 600 children were enrolled into the study: 199 aged 6 weeks to &lt;6 months, 202 aged 6 months to &lt; 12 months, and 199 aged 12 month to 24 months. Typeable pneumococci were identified in 297/600 (49·5%) of samples with more than one serotype being found in 67/297 (20·2%) of these samples. The serotypes covered by the thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were identified in 44·4% of samples containing typeable pneumococci. Application of a molecular serotyping approach to identification of multiple pneumococcal carriage demonstrates a substantial prevalence of co-colonisation. Continued surveillance utilising this approach following the introduction of routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccinates in infants will provide a more accurate understanding of vaccine efficacy against carriage and a better understanding of the dynamics of subsequent serotype and genotype replacement.",10.5061/dryad.5v6qm,microarray|carriage|children|Pneumococcus,"Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford|Department of Pathology, University of Otago|Paediatric Research Unit, Patan Academy of Health Sciences|NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre|Division of Clinical Sciences, St. George's University of London",Streptococcus Pneumoniae,,2015-02-03,DRYAD,"Data from: Multi-serotype pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence in vaccine naïve Nepalese children, assessed using molecular serotyping.",,

This approach differs from the standard Fst in that it can accommodate genetic similarity between individuals in a general form. We apply this strategy to complete genome data from 47 wild and domestic pigs from Asia and Europe. When we partitioned the total genomic variance into components associated to subsets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defined in terms of their annotation, we found that potentially deleterious non-synonymous mutations (9566 SNPs) explained as much genetic variance as the whole set of 25 million SNPs. This suggests that domestication may have affected protein sequence to a larger extent than regulatory or other kinds of mutations. A pathway-guided analysis revealed ovarian steroidogenesis and leptin signaling as highly relevant in domestication. The genomic regression approach proposed in this study revealed molecular processes not apparent through typical differentiation statistics. We propose that at least some of these processes are likely new discoveries because domestication is a dynamic process of genetic selection, which may not be completely characterized by a static metric like Fst. Nevertheless, and despite some particularly influential mutation types or pathways, our analyses tend to rule out a simplistic genetic basis for the domestication process: neither a single pathway nor a unique set of SNPs can explain the process as a whole.",10.5061/dryad.r6t26,domestication|pig|heritability,Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG)|Michigan State University|Queensland Bioscience Precinct|CSIC-IRTA-UAB-UB Consortium|Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics|CSIRO Agriculture|Institut Català de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA),Sus scrofa,,2016-07-11,DRYAD,Data from: The ‘heritability’ of domestication and its functional partitioning in the pig,,

Although the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance is well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms linking the genetic basis of resistance to its fitness cost remain poorly characterized. Here, we examine how the system-wide impacts of mutations in the RNA polymerase (RNAP) gene rpoB shape the fitness cost of rifampin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rifampin resistance mutations reduce transcriptional efficiency, and this explains 76% of the variation in fitness among rpoB mutants. The pleiotropic consequence of rpoB mutations is that mutants show altered relative transcript levels of essential genes. We find no evidence that global transcriptional responses have an impact on the fitness cost of rifampin resistance as revealed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Global changes in the transcriptional profiles of rpoB mutants compared to the transcriptional profile of the rifampin-sensitive ancestral strain are subtle, demonstrating that the transcriptional regulatory network of P. aeruginosa is robust to the decreased transcriptional efficiency associated with rpoB mutations. On a smaller scale, we find that rifampin resistance mutations increase the expression of RNAP due to decreased termination at an attenuator upstream from rpoB, and we argue that this helps to minimize the cost of rifampin resistance by buffering against reduced RNAP activity. In summary, our study shows that it is possible to dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning variation in the cost of rifampin resistance and highlights the importance of genome-wide buffering of relative transcript levels in providing robustness against resistance mutations.

IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance mutations carry fitness costs. Relative to the characteristics of their antibiotic-sensitive ancestors, resistant mutants show reduced growth rates and competitive abilities. Fitness cost plays an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the absence of antibiotics; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these fitness costs is not well understood. We applied a systems-level approach to dissect the molecular underpinnings of the fitness costs associated with rifampin resistance in P. aeruginosa and showed that most of the variation in fitness cost can be explained by the direct effect of resistance mutations on the enzymatic activity of the mutated gene.

Porosity parameters can modify the scaffold hydrophilicity and permeability that in turn regulate the protein adsorption, cellular attachment and infiltration, and vascularization of the scaffold. Various methods have been investigated for control of porosity parameters; however, the field still suffers from major controversies and challenges; i.e., inability to customize the porosity and hydrophilicity at different levels. Therefore, considering the biomimetic strategies in replicating the natural tissue, this study explored a new integrated approach for control of porosity within nanocomposite collagen/nano-biphasic calcium phosphate (collagen/nBCP) scaffold. For this purpose, the ability of “TPGS (vitamin E) as a potent biocompatible porogen was explored during a modified freeze-drying procedure. Several processing variables were studied in parallel in controlling the porosity parameters including; different quenching rates (-18 ℃, -80 ℃, and -196 ℃), collagen/nBCP ratios (92/8% and 85/15%), and TPGS ratios (5% and 15%). The physicochemical characteristics of the scaffold were studied using different techniques with a particular focus on porosimetry analysis. The results showed that careful control of TPGS and quenching rate could increase the range of pore size and actively modify the pore shape, while collagen/nBCP ratio mostly affected total porosity and roughness. The collagen/nBCP ratio of 92/8% with TPGS treated at the quenching rate of -80 ℃ showed more favorable and consistent physicochemical behaviors, i.e., higher porosity and hydrophilicity. This method allowed production of scaffold displaying multimodal heterogeneous pore distribution with an increase in the range of pore size of mostly round/oval pore morphology (similar to natural bone) and a high hydrophilicity that supported a better cellular performance. Considering the various medical benefits of TPGS, its careful application as surfactant-porogen tailored with its therapeutic potentials could provide a promising insight for production of customized scaffold for various tissue engineering applications. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to fully explore the potential of this integrated approach.",10.17632/gfwtzygf9c.1,Biomaterials Processing|Biomaterials Characterization|Biomimetic Synthesis|Nanoscale Biomaterials|Bone Tissue Engineering|Permeability|Porosity,Prince Philip Dental Hospital|Queen Mary Hospital|Metal and Materials Technology Center,Biomaterials Processing|Biomaterials Characterization|Biomimetic Synthesis|Nanoscale Biomaterials|Bone Tissue Engineering|Permeability|Porosity,,2019-07-02,MENDELEY_DATA,Evaluation of “Vitamin E” as an active surfactant for production of novel bone scaffolds with controlled porosity and hydrophilicity,article,1

However, because of non-linearities of the response of biochemical systems to their reagent concentrations, a broad dynamic range is necessary. Here we demonstrate the use of a high-performance nanoliter handling platform (Labcyte Echo 525) and computer generation of liquid transfer programs to explore in quadruplicates more than 600 combination of 4 parameters of a biochemical reaction, which lead us to uncover non-linear responses, parameter interactions and novel mechanical insights. With the increased availability of « cloud biology » computer-driven laboratory platforms, our results participate in changing methods development for biotechnology towards reproducible, computer-aided exhaustive characterisation of biochemical systems.

The weakening or strengthening of synapses is driven by translational and/or post-translational changes in their proteins composition, the so-called “synaptic proteome”. Its composition is highly dynamic both in basal condition and as a result of synaptic activity. Therefore, acquisition of data on the proteomic changes underlying synaptic plasticity is crucial to properly understand the molecular mechanisms by which these organelles modify their weight according to activity. Although it is possible to obtain the proteomic profile of synaptic proteins from a bunch of different preparations (Sharma et al., 2015; Biesmann et al., 2013; Distler et al., 2014; Loh 2016) these methods do not allow to specifically detecting proteomic changes in activated synapses. Hence, with this study we aim at providing a pilot proteome dataset from hippocampal activated synapses by taking advantages of a recently developed activity-dependent synaptic expression vector . The method is based on the new expression vector pSYNACTIVE (Gobbo et al., 2017) that allows to achieve the activity dependent translation of reporter proteins at activated dendritic spines. This is possible as the pSYNACTIVE vector exploits the 5’UTR and 3’UTR RNA sequences of Arc/Arg3.1 mRNA and a PSD-targeting protein sequence fused to the report (Gobbo et al., 2017). The experimental approach we propose has several advantages over the existing methods as it allows to: i) correlating protein abundance in activated synapses with the strengthening of excitatory synapses; ii) obtaining the functional mapping of activated synapses. By doing so it is possible to establish how different pattern of activity may activate different subset of excitatory synapses.",10.25493/jzs5-bc5,Neuroscience,,,,2019-01-01,hbp.neuroinf,Activity-dependent changes of spine proteomes,,

Recently, several studies focused on the use of genomes to gain information about past ecological conditions. Several used the property that the G+C and amino-acid contents of bacterial and archaeal rDNA genes and proteins, respectively, are strongly influenced by the environmental temperature. The adaptation to optimal growth temperature (OGT) since the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) over the universal tree of life was examined and it was concluded that LUCA was likely to have been a mesophilic organism and that a parallel adaptation to high temperature occurred independently along the two lineages leading to the ancestors of Bacteria on one side and of Archaea+Eukarya on the other side. Here, we focus on Archaea to gain a precise view of the adaptation to OGT over time in this domain. It has been often proposed on the basis of indirect evidence that the last archaeal common ancestor was a hyperthermophilic organism. Moreover, many results showed the influence of environmental temperature on the evolutionary dynamics of archaeal genomes: thermophilic organisms generally display lower evolutionary rates than mesophiles. However, to our knowledge, no study tried to explain the differences of evolutionary rates for the entire archaeal domain and to investigate the evolution of substitution rates over time. A comprehensive archaeal phylogeny and a non‐homogeneous model of the molecular evolutionary process allowed us to estimate ancestral base and amino acid compositions and optimal growth temperatures at each internal node of the archaeal phylogenetic tree. The last archaeal common ancestor is predicted to have been hyperthermophilic and adaptations to cooler environments can be observed for extant mesophilic species. Furthermore, mesophilic species present both long branches and high variation of nucleotide and amino acid compositions since the last archaeal common ancestor. The increase of substitution rates observed in mesophilic lineages along all their branches can be interpreted as an ongoing adaptation to colder temperatures and to new metabolisms. We conclude that environmental temperature is a major factor that governs evolutionary rates in Archaea.",10.5061/dryad.8976,,Laboratoire de Biométrie et Biologie Evolutive|CNRS|Université de Lyon,,,2011-03-28,DRYAD,Data from: Adaptation to environmental temperature is a major determinant of molecular evolutionary rates in Archaea,,

The application of molecular phylogenetic techniques has identified the origins of numerous allopolyploids, but little is known on genomic and chromosomal consequences of allopolyploidization, despite their important role in conferring divergence of allopolyploids from their parental species. Here, using several plastid and nuclear sequence markers, we clarify the origin of tetra- and hexaploids in a group of American daisies, allowing characterization of genome dynamics in polyploids compared to their diploid ancestors. All polyploid species are allopolyploids. Among the four diploid gene pools, the propensity for allopolyploidization is unevenly distributed phylogenetically with a few species apparently more prone to participate, but the underlying causes remain unclear. Polyploid genomes are characterized by differential loss of ribosomal DNA loci (5S and 35S rDNA), known hotspots of chromosomal evolution, but show genome size additivity, suggesting limited changes beyond those affecting rDNA loci or the presence of processes counterbalancing genome reduction. Patterns of rDNA sequence conversion and provenance of the lost loci are highly idiosyncratic and differ even between allopolyploids of identical parentage, indicating that allopolyploids deriving from the same lower-ploid parental species can follow different evolutionary trajectories.",10.5061/dryad.3n148,rDNA|Chromosomal Evolution|fluorescence in situ hybridisation|phylogeny|allopolyploidy|genome size,"Instituto de Biología, Departamento de Botánica|Department of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany|University of Vienna|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México",Asteraceae|Melampodium|Compositae|sect.

Since their origin in the 17th century, publications in scientific journals have become the foundation of scholarly communication. Yet the publication process itself, duties and responsibilities of editors, and the preparation of manuscripts for submission have gone through many changes. The current drive towards study registration, sharing of protocols, manuscript pre-print, full transparency of reporting and the use of reporting guidelines, data sharing, and study replication, are seen as the future of scientific communication and methods of preventing scientific misconduct and undesirable research practices.

The goals of this project are:

1) Study the current state of publication ethics, research integrity- and transparency-related policies of scholarly Journals (by analysing instructions to authors from a representative sample of journals in the humanities, social, natural, and life sciences);

2) Study the trends and changes in publication ethics, research integrity- and transparency-related policies of scholarly Journals (by conducting a systematic review of all studies indexed in MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus that have analysed instructions to authors of journals);

3) Study editors’, authors’ and reviewer’ perceptions and attitudes towards topics related to transparent and responsible conduct of research (by conducting large scale surveys, focus group, web-chats and acceleration room sessions);

4) Make (evidence-based) recommendations of how publishers and journals may implement publication principles and foster the integrity and transparency of research (by summarizing the evidence of the first 3 steps of the project).

Absorption to the structureless 3s Rydberg state begins at 19,600 cm-1, though no REMPI spectrum is observed due to the fast predissociative nature of the state.  Instead, the onset is detected using photofragment spectroscopy of H and D atoms.  The electronic transition has a perpendicular transition moment, analogous to CH2OH.  The onset of the predissociative 3pz state can be detected via REMPI, and is observed at 32360 cm-1.  Photofragments detected from dissociation of this state show no recoil anisotropy.  However, the β parameter becomes more negative (indicative of a perpendicular electronic transition moment) as the excitation energy is decreased.  The transition becomes more anisotropic as the energy decreases through the predicted region of the 3px Rydberg state towards the onset of the 3s state.  The onset of the transition to the 3px state cannot be identified due to the large background signal from the 3s state.  The translational energy distributions of H and D atims indicates that both the O-H(D) and C(2)-H(D) bonds can be broken at sufficiently high energies.; The ground state photodissociation dynamics of CD2CD2OH radical were studied to determine product branching ratios and look for evidence of vinyl alcohol (CD2CDOH) product.  Deuterated 2-hydroxyethyl radical (CD2CD2OH) was generated from photodissociation of the BrCD2CD2OH precursor by cleaving the Br-C bond at the wavelengths 202, 205, 210, and 215 nm.  The energy left in the CD2CD2OH radical after breaking this bond led to the spontaneous dissociation of the radical.  The presence of acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol products was inferred by monitoring the velocity distribution of the D atom co-fragment in the dissociation, and using conservation of energy to determine the identity of the molecular fragment.  Different photolysis wavelengths were used to determine whether an obvious change in branching ratio between D and OH dissociation products would become evident as less energy for dissociation became available to the system.  No precipitous drop in D products was seen toward longer photolysis wavelengths.  However, a high velocity tail became apparent at longer wavelengths, indicating the onset of 2-photon processes at these energies.  These processes are proposed to be owed to two phenomena:  an absorption by the radical beginning at 210 nm, and lengthening of the lifetime of the excited radical as the available energy above the centrifugal barrier becomes smaller.; Both acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol products were seen in the dissociation of CD2CD2OH.  In agreement with RRKM calculations, vinyl alcohol products are expected to constitute the majority of the dissociations to D + molecular co-fragment.",10.25549/usctheses-m3380,hydroxyethyl|REMPI|Chemistry (Chemical Physics)|vinyl alcohol,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Spectroscopy and photodissociation dynamics of hydroxyethyl radicals,,

Taxon-specific metabarcoding ratios (ratio of consumed prey to available prey in the surrounding seawater) revealed diverse and dynamic copepod feeding selection, with positive selection on large diatoms, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and fungi, while smaller phytoplankton, including P. pouchetii, were passively consumed or even negatively selected according to our indicator. Our analysis of the relationship between Calanus grazing ratios and intracellular metabolite profiles indicates the importance of carbohydrates and lipids in plankton succession and copepod–prey interactions. This molecular characterization of Calanus sp. grazing therefore provides new evidence for selective feeding in mixed plankton assemblages and corroborates previous findings that copepod grazing may be coupled to the developmental and metabolic stage of the entire prey community rather than to individual prey abundances.",10.5061/dryad.6tn7c,Protists|Predator Prey Interactions|Foodwebs|Diet Analysis,Jenabios GmbH|P.P.

In a replicated greenhouse experiment with the aquatic microbial community that inhabits the cup-shaped leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea, we monitored O2 levels and the concentration of bovine serum album (BSA), an effective molecular substitute for detritus. Low BSA enrichment rates triggered a classic hysteresis response, a substantial lag in the return of O2 levels. At intermediate BSA enrichment rates, O2 levels closely tracked BSA concentrations during both the enrichment and recovery phases. High BSA enrichment rates induced an unusual ""anti-clockwise"" hysteresis in which O2 levels were higher during the recovery phase than during the enrichment phase. These experiments revealed complex dynamic behavior in response to enrichment rates of a single environmental driver. Our results suggest that the past trajectory of enrichment is critical for understanding how systems will respond to restoration initiatives. Specifically, systems that have been exposed to chronic low levels of enrichment may be the ones that are most resistant to restoration efforts that reduce nutrient or detrital inputs.",10.6073/pasta/ebf6b175a6f6e44d3e9747c13f0d376c,,,,,2020-01-01,edi.edi,Hysteresis of the Sarracenia Purpurea Microecosystem in Northern Vermont 2015-2016,,

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) results from a t(9;22) (q34; q11) translocation, also called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). This reciprocal translocation causes a constitutively-activated tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL fusion gene. By comparing imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cell models, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivative TMQ0153 triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis at low concentrations accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increase of cytosolic free Ca2+ levels. Interestingly, at higher concentrations, TMQ0153 induced necroptotic cell death with accumulation of ROS, both preventable by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment. At necroptosis-inducing concentrations, we observed increased ROS and decreased ATP and GSH levels, concomitant with protective autophagy induction. Inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 (baf-A1) and siRNA against beclin 1 abrogated autophagy, sensitized CML cells against TMQ0153 and enhanced necroptotic cell death. Importantly, TMQ153-induced necrosis led to cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT) and ERp57 as well as the release of extracellular ATP and high mobility group box (HMGB1) demonstrating the immunological cell death markers by TMQ0153. We validated the anti-cancer potential of TMQ0153 by in vivo inhibition of K562 microtumor formation in zebrafish. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that cellular stress and redox modulation by TMQ0153 concentration-dependently leads to different cell death modalities including controlled necrosis in CML cell models.

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that TMQ0153-induced ROS act as a rheostat determining the onset of apoptotic- or autophagy-related controlled necrotic cell death in CML.

Specifically, spherically expanding flames were studied in the context of heat loss and molecular transport effects. Ignition adjacent to a cold wall was also examined for mixtures that exhibited the negative temperature coefficient behavior, and species stratification due to Ludwig-Soret diffusion. For this purpose, a transient one-dimensional reacting flow code was developed to accurately simulate flame propagation and ignition in the low Mach number regime. ❧ Computations of flames of heavy molecular weight fuel/air mixtures revealed that the response of such flames to stretch is governed by different mechanisms for fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures. The dynamics of lean mixtures are controlled by the Lewis number which quantifies the non-equidiffusion of heat from and chemical energy into the flame, while for rich mixtures, the response to stretch is governed by the difference in diffusivities between the fuel and oxidizer. It was further demonstrated that, extrapolation equations derived based on numerous simplifying assumptions, when utilized to derive laminar flame speeds from constant pressure spherically expanding flame experimental data, result in substantial uncertainties in the stretch-corrected values. Simulation results also showed that the radiation heat loss from the burned gas ball can lead to non-ideal fluid dynamic effects that imparts uncertainties in the flame speeds derived using flame expansion rate measurements and that additional measurement of the unburned gas velocity is required to circumvent the flow induced uncertainty. ❧ Consistency between data obtained from counterflow and spherically expanding flame configurations was established by comparing the difference between direct measurements and detailed simulation results for each configuration. The consistency obtained when avoiding the erroneous extrapolation procedure transformed into discrepancy when results post-extrapolation are compared. ❧ Measurements made during the compression stage of spherically expanding flame propagation in a constant volume vessel is identified as the ideal method to probe flame propagation at conditions of high pressure and temperature. Computations revealed that the flame speeds derived from pressure measurements are highly sensitive to the accuracy of burned gas mass fraction as a function of pressure, which is traditionally determined using thermodynamics-based models. Thus, neglecting radiation energy loss from the burned gas can result in errors in flame speed as large as 15%. Besides, simulation results illustrated that measurements made during the compression stage do not require stretch correction as the compression induced fluid flow results in near stretch-free flames. ❧ Simulations performed to study the influence of the thermal boundary layer adjacent to a cold wall on the ignition behavior of a combustible gas revealed that exothermic centers could preferentially develop locally in the boundary layer for mixtures that exhibit the negative temperature coefficient behavior and also for mixtures that can stratify as a result of Ludwig-Soret diffusion. This inhomogeneous ignition could result in incorrect interpretation of experimental data from legacy kinetic experiments and could play a role central to the initiation of knock in engines.",10.25549/usctheses-c40-232322,Soret effect|spherically expanding flame|chemical kinetics|ignition phenomena|boundary layer effect|premixed flames|Ludwig-Soret effect|laminar flame speed|Mechanical Engineering|negative temperature coefficient,,,,2016-01-01,usc.dl,Modeling investigations of fundamental combustion phenomena in low-dimensional configurations,,

Synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) exist in a delicate balance, which is disturbed in a number of diseases. In Alzheimer’s Disease, the balance is skewed towards LTD, which results in cognitive impairments. Long-term synaptic plasticity relies on Calcium signalling in the postsynaptic neuron and the activation of calmodulin and, subsequently, of CaMKII or calcineurin, leading to the induction of LTP or LTD, respectively. In Alzheimer’s disease, basal Calcium levels are elevated because of changes in Ca release from intracellular stores, and in transmembrane receptor function. This results in increased activation of calcineurin and hence, increased LTD. We develop a spatial particle-based stochastic model of Ca signalling in the dendritic spine in early LTP and LTD. The model includes Calcium influx through, activation of calmodulin, activation of calmodulin-dependent kinases and phosphatases and their effect on AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor function. This model helps us understand downstream effects of Calcium dysregulation in Alzheimer’s disease. We tested the impact of different calcium levels on the molecular pathways of long term plasticity. The healthy version of the model shows how the calcium signalling works in the dendritic spine head. While disease model have impaired calcium pumps, which leads to a build up of calcium within the spine head.

,"McCandlish, David M.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9b5q2pv,OTHER|DATASET,2018-08-17,"Understanding evolution on complex fitness landscapes is difficult both because of the large dimensionality of sequence space and the stochasticity inherent to population-genetic processes. Here I present an integrated suite of mathematical  tools for understanding evolution on time-invariant fitness landscapes when mutations occur sufficiently rarely that the population is typically monomorphic and evolution can be modeled as a sequence of well-separated fixation events. The basic intuition behind this suite of tools is that surrounding any particular genotype lies a region of the fitness landscape that is easy to evolve to, while other pieces of the fitness landscape are difficult to evolve to (due to distance, being across a fitness valley, etc.). I propose a rigorous definition for this ``dynamical neighborhood' of a genotype which captures several aspects of the distribution of waiting times to evolve from one genotype to another. The neighborhood structure of the landscape as a whole can be summarized as a matrix, and I show how this matrix can be used to approximate the expected waiting time for certain evolutionary events to occur and to provide an intuitive interpretation to existing formal results on the index of dispersion of the molecular clock.",10.5061/dryad.9b5q2pv,,,,,2018-08-17,DRYAD,Data from: Long-term evolution on complex fitness landscapes when mutation is weak,,

However, as farmers adopt new varieties, in situ population structure and genetic diversity of their seed holdings can change drastically. Consequences of adoption are still poorly understood due to a lack of crop genetic diversity assessments and detailed surveys of farmers’ seed management practices. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is an excellent model for these types of studies, as it has a long history of cultivation among smallholder farmers, exhibits eco-geographic patterns of diversity (e.g., Andean vs. Mesoamerican gene-pools), and has been subjected to post-Columbian dispersal and recent introduction of improved cultivars. The Hoima district of western Uganda additionally provides an excellent social setting for evaluating consequences of adoption because access to improved varieties has varied across farmer groups in this production region. This study establishes a baseline understanding of the common bean diversity found among household producers in Uganda and compares the crop population structure, diversity and consequences of adoption of household producers with different adoption practices. Molecular diversity analysis, based on 4,955 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, evaluated a total of 1,156 seed samples that included 196 household samples collected from household producers in the Hoima district, nineteen breeder-selected varieties used in participatory breeding activities that had taken place prior to the study in the region, and a global bean germplasm collection. Households that had participated in regional participatory breeding efforts were more likely to adopt new varieties and, consequently, diversify their seed stocks than those that had not participated. Of the three farmer groups that participated in breeding efforts, households from the farmer group with the longest history of bean production were more likely to conserve “Seed Engufu”, a local “Calima”-type variety of the Andean bean gene pool, and, at the same time, introduce rare Mesoamerican gene pool varieties into household seed stocks.,Plant Material The collection included a set of 196 household samples collected from producers in Hoima district, nineteen breeder-selected varieties (Table 1) originating from either the CIAT-Kawanda, Uganda, or CIAT-Cali, Colombia, germplasm collections. For comparison, this study included a database of a world-wide reference germplasm collection that consisted of 502 accessions of the Andean Diversity Panel (Cichy et al., 2015), 363 accessions of the USDA core collection (McClean et al., 2012; S. Kuzay, P. Hamilton-Conaty and P. Gepts, unpubl. results), and 57 reference and commercial cultivars. A subset of the breeder-selected samples included in the analysis had been evaluated and made available to breeding program-affiliated households through the CIAT-managed PVS trials from 2012 to 2013. Within the breeder-selected varieties, NABE 11, 15, 17 and 21 were bred locally by the national Ugandan bean program using CIAT-bred lines while the remaining NABE lines were bred under CIAT-led programs. The KAT lines had been bred locally by a Kenyan breeder at the Katumani Research Station in the 1990’s. The 196 household seed stock samples were collected from eight-two households between May and June of 2014, within 2-3 weeks of the first harvest since PVS trials were completed. SNP-Based Genotyping The Illumina Infinium “BeadChip BARCBean6K-3” (Song et al., 2015) from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture BeanCAP Project (Grant number 2009-01929) was used to genotype the entire seed collection. Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was conducted courtesy of Dr. Perry Cregan, USDA-ARS, Soybean Genomics Improvement Laboratory, BARC-West, Beltsville, MD, on the Illumina platform following the Infinium HD Assay Ultra Protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequencing output of the BARCBean6K-3 BeanChip was evaluated using GenomeStudio software. Clusterw2 software was used to align sequences and generate SNP calls. In order to generate reliable SNP calls for household seed samples and breeder-selected samples, cluster files were calibrated from the default set of cluster files. 4,955 of the 5,398 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were then called using the new cluster files with a Gencall score cutoff of 0.15, according to the GenomeStudio Genotyping Module v1.8.4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). SNP data of samples from the global germplasm collection BARCBean6K-3 assay were filtered to include only those having less than 5% missing data and 5% heterozygosity. SNP data of the remaining samples were pruned to 1,870 markers to reduce linkage disequilibrium. Pruning was performed in a moving window of 50 SNPs removing one of a pair of SNPs if the linkage disequilibrium was higher than 0.6. The steps of filtering and pruning were performed in PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007).,",10.25338/b8cs3z,,,,,2018-01-01,cdl.ucd,Genetic Patterns of Common-Bean Seed Acquisition and Early-stage Adoption among Farmer Groups in Western Uganda,,1

,"Coreil, Jeannine|Lauzardo, Michael|Yiliang, Zhu",https://doi.org/10.3886%2Ficpsr30521,DATASET,,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a public health problem of global magnitude. In the United States its victims are primarily the poor, foreign immigrants, and persons with AIDS. Efforts to control the disease are severely handicapped by the effects of social stigma and further compounded by issues of race, social class, ethnic stereotypes, immigrant status, and HIV coinfection. The study investigated the social dynamics of stigma in relation to TB in two populations particularly affected by all of these issues, Haitians in the United States and in Haiti. The theoretical framework of the study was cultural epidemiology, which combines quantitative and qualitative measures to study experience, meaning, and behavior in subpopulations of interest. The study design enabled important comparisons across national settings that highlight the differential effects of political-economic context, differences in stigma dynamics for active disease compared to latent infection, and measured the impact of stigma on adherence to preventive therapy. Study components included an ethnography of TB stigma, a cross-cultural epidemiologic study, and a community trial of adherence to preventive therapy. Study sites were South Florida, United States, and Leogane, Haiti. The study aimed to investigate: (1) differences in the degree and components of stigma across different sociocultural settings and comparison groups (community members, health care providers, patients); (2) differential stigma effects in a public vs. private, culturally competent clinic; (3) correlates of TB-related stigma; and (4) the influence of perceived stigma on adherence to latent tuberculosis therapy. Data were collected between 2003-2006 in three phases: Phase I Ethnographic Research; Phase II Cultural Epidemiologic Study; and Phase III Adherence Study. A total of 768 persons were interviewed, including 408 women (53 percent) and 360 men (47 percent). All study aims were completed with the exception of No. 2, which was not possible due to the closure of the Haitian Community Clinic in South Florida. The study consists of data from community, patient, and provider interviews. Demographic variables include sex, age, primary language, education level, employment status, marital status, and religion.,Specific Aims: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the sociocultural context of tuberculosis in Florida and in Haiti, with particular focus on aspects of social stigma related to the disease. (2) Conduct instrument development studies in Florida and in Haiti using the EMIC protocol to produce culturally valid measures of stigma for each setting. (3) Conduct a cultural epidemiologic study of stigma related to tuberculosis in Florida and in Haiti, measuring level of disease-related stigma among three populations in each setting: TB patients, clinic staff, and community residents. There will be two separate populations of patients and clinic staff in Florida (Broward County), one drawn from a public health department clinic, the other from a private Haitian-staffed clinic. Comparison of stigma scores will be made across all groups. (4) Test the hypothesis that perceived stigma is negatively associated with adherence to preventive TB therapy through a quasi-experimental cohort study of latent TB patients in Florida, monitoring both acceptance of preventive therapy as well as adherence to therapy over time. Predictive association between acceptance/duration of treatment and stigma scores will be analyzed.,The Cultural Epidemiologic Study component of the study was adapted based on the EMIC framework for cultural studies of illness developed by Weiss and colleagues (Weiss et al. 1992; Weiss 1997; Weiss 2001; Weiss et al., 2006). The EMIC is a set of protocols for studying cultural components of particular illnesses, including experience, meaning, and behavior. It is operationalized into patterns of distress (PD), perceived causes (PC), and help-seeking (HS). It uses an open-ended query approach to elicit a respondent's perceptions or representations of an illness. Basic questions include ""What is the problem?"", ""What is the cause?"", and ""What kinds of help are appropriate?"". In addition, a special subscale within the EMIC was developed to measure disease-related stigma. The particular set of items used in the Stigma Scale varied depending on the illness condition, cultural context, and population targeted.,Interviewees were selected from three populations: community residents, clinic staff, and clinic patients. Separate open-ended interview guides were developed for each group. The guides included questions related to how Haitians are viewed in South Florida, health problems in the Haitian community, individual and collective behavior related to stigmatized illnesses, explanatory models of tuberculosis, and the impact of tuberculosis on affected individuals. Health care providers were also asked about their experience caring for tuberculosis patients, challenges of providing care to culturally diverse populations, and the difficulties faced by TB patients.,ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection: Performed consistency checks.; Created variable labels and/or value labels.; Standardized missing values.; Created online analysis version with question text.; Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.; Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes..,Datasets:

This was made up of 293 community (38.15 percent), 316 patient (41.15 percent), and 159 provider respondents (20.7 percent). Community residents were recruited using an organization-based cluster sampling technique (Bernard, 1988; Chavez et al. 1999). Five types of organizations serving the Haitian community were targeted: churches, schools (parents and teachers), businesses, civic/recreational organizations, and social service agencies. Adults between the ages of 18 and 80 were selected through contacts of the research team within the organizations and from information listed in a Haitian Resource booklet provided by Broward County Health Department. For the clinic sample, clinical, outreach and administrative staff from tuberculosis programs and services were interviewed. Patients were selected from hospital (Haiti) or public health department (Florida) TB clinics and included patients with both active disease and latent TB infection (LTBI).,",10.3886/icpsr30521,,,,,2012-01-01,gesis.icpsr,"Stigma and Tuberculosis in Haitian Populations: A cross-national study of the impact of stigma on patient experience and clinical outcomes in Haiti and the United States, 2003-2008,Archival Version,",,

They are characterized by ceaseless flows of organic, chemical and microbial matter, followed by treatment steps before environmental release. WWTPs are hotspots of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria via conjugative plasmids, leading to dissemination of potentially hazardous genetic material such as antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRGs). While current focus is on the threat of AMRGs spreading and environmental maintenance, conjugative plasmid transfer dynamics within and between bacterial communities still remains largely uncharted. Furthermore, current in vitro methods used to assess conjugation in complex microbiomes do not include in situ behaviors of recipient cells, resulting in partial representation of transfers. We investigated the in vitro conjugation capacities of WWTP microbiomes from inlet sewage and outlet treated water using the broad host-range IncP-1 conjugative plasmid, pKJK5. A thorough molecular approach coupling metagenomes to 16S rRNA DNA/cDNA amplicon sequencing was established to characterize microbiomes using the ecological concept of functional response groups. A broad diversity of recipient bacterial phyla for the plasmid in wastewater was observed, especially in WWTP outlets. We also identified permissive bacteria potentially able to cross WWTPs and engage in conjugation before and after water treatment. Bacterial activity and lifestyles seem to influence conjugation extent, as treated water copiotrophs were the most represented strategists amongst transconjugants. Correlation analysis highlighted possible plasmid transmission routes into communities between the sewage to the environment, with identification of keystone members (e.g. Arcobacter) potentially involved in cross-border exchanges between distant Gram-positive and negative phyla.",10.5061/dryad.636b0,Metagenomics|Niche Modelling|Microbial Biology|Molecular Evolution|Bioinfomatics/Phyloinfomatics|Community Ecology,Department of Biology|Section of Microbiology|University of Copenhagen,,,2017-04-06,DRYAD,Data from: Deciphering conjugative plasmid permissiveness dynamics in wastewater microbiomes,,

In the presence of lateral gene transfer (LGT), however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modelling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared to the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to, and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events − 28% – appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.",10.5061/dryad.27d0g,macroevolution|gene tree reconciliation|phylogeny|lateral gene transfer,"UMR 5506|Laboratoire de Biométrie et Biologie Evolutive|Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier|Unité Mixte de Recherche 5558|Université de Montréal|Université de Lyon|Centre Robert-Cedergren Pour la Bioinformatique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique Rhône-Alpes|Département de Biochimie|UMR 5506|Laboratoire de Biométrie et Biologie Evolutive|Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier|Unité Mixte de Recherche 5558|Université de Montréal|Université de Lyon|Centre Robert-Cedergren Pour la Bioinformatique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique Rhône-Alpes|Département de Biochimie",,,2013-01-16,DRYAD,Data from: Lateral gene transfer from the dead,,

Low cost representational sampling of the genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shows great potential at the temporal scales that are typically the focus of species delimitation and phylogeography. We apply these markers to a case study of a freshwater turtle, Emydura macquarii, whose systematics has so far defied resolution, to bring to light a dynamic system of incipient species held back by low level and episodic exchange of alleles across drainage divides on various timescales. Emydura macquarii is a polytypic species complex comprising a set of allopatric lineages and incipient species at various shallow levels of molecular (and morphological) divergence that can interbreed to exchange alleles and do so where their ranges come into contact. In the context of low-level episodic gene flow, speciation is often reticulate, not a bifurcating process. Species delimitation needs to take into account the pattern of ancestry and descent of diverging lineages in allopatry (phylogenetics) together with the recent and contemporary processes of dispersal and gene flow (population genetics) that retard and obscure that divergence. This combined approach provides a means for addressing the challenges of incompletely isolated populations with uncommon, but recurrent gene flow in studies of species delimitation, a combination likely to be frequently encountered. The accompanying taxonomic judgements can avoid the risk of the taxonomic inflation that can accompany phylogenetic or lineage approaches to species delimitation.",10.5061/dryad.t2c668d,species delimitation|tokogenesis|phylogeny|cladogeneisis,,Emydura macquarii,,2018-10-23,DRYAD,Data from: Genome-wide SNP markers breathe new life into phylogeography and species delimitation for the problematic short-necked turtles (Chelidae: Emydura) of eastern Australia,,

Amelogenesis involves two major functional stages—secretory and maturation. The transition of ameloblasts from secretory to maturation stage, which is characterized by both morphological and functional changes, results in the formation of mature enamel with ordered crystallite structures. Although researcher today have a very clear idea of the molecular activities that define secretory‐stage amelogenesis, the molecular events that define enamel maturation remain understudied. ❧ In chapter two, we set out to investigate the potential role of miRNA regulation in maturation‐stage tooth development. We conducted genome‐wide miRNA and mRNA transcript expression profiling analyses of secretory‐stage and maturation‐stage enamel organs obtained from rat incisors. We identified a group of stage‐specific miRNAs and identified candidate gene targets based on bioinformatic prediction. Two maturation‐stage‐related genes, Lamp1 and Tfrc, were verified by luciferase reporter assay to be the target genes of miRNA regulators. The results indicated a dynamic expression pattern of miRNAs during the transition from secretory‐stage to maturation‐stage enamel mineralization, and suggest that miRNAs can influence key processes of enamel maturation. ❧ Based on the bioinformatic analyses in chapter two, Slc26 gene family were identified to be involved in the pH regulation process during enamel maturation. Among the 11 members in Slc26 gene family, Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are the only members whose transcripts are significantly up-regulated during maturation‐stage enamel formation when compared to secretory‐stage. In chapter three, we investigated the function roles of Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 during enamel maturation. We conducted quantitative real‐time PCR and Western blot analyses to show that Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are all significantly up‐regulated at maturation‐stage (relative to secretory‐stage) at both miRNA and protein levels. The subsequent immunolocalization assays showed that in the maturation‐stage ameloblasts the gene products of Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 localize to the apical region of cytoplasmic membrane, similar to the localization of pattern of Cftr in maturation‐stage ameloblasts. In addition, the distribution of Slc26a7 was also seen within the cytoplasmic/subapical region of ameloblast, presumably on the lysosomal membrane. From the protein complex pulled down using an antibody to Cftr; Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 were each separately detected by the subsequent immunoblotting, suggesting the direct interaction of each of these three proteins Slc26 proteins with Cftr. Compared with wild‐type (WT) animals, Slc26a1-/- or Slc26a7-/- animals did not show any significant abnormalities in the mature enamel phenotype (density and structure). However, many gene transcripts examined by real‐time PCR—such as Car2 (carbonic anhydrase 2), Cftr, Slc4a4/NBCe1, Slc4a9/Ae4, Slc26a9 and Alpl (alkaline phosphatase)—showed significant up‐regulation in the enamel organ cells of Slc26a1-/- and Slc26a7-/- animals when compared to age and sex‐matched wild‐type controls. Collectively, these data indicated that Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are actively involved in ion transport related to pH regulation processes during enamel maturation and their functional roles may be achieved, at least in part, by forming complex interactions with Cftr.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-572083,enamel maturation|microRNA|Cranio-Facial Biology|Slc26as|pH regulation|amelogenesis,,,,2016-01-01,usc.dl,Global analysis of the molecular activities defining maturation-stage amelogenesis,,

Despite that, genetic information is largely neglected in conservation planning, and how conservation units should be defined is still heatedly debated. Here, we use maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), an outcrossing long lived tree with a highly fragmented distribution in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, to prove the importance of accounting for genetic variation - at both neutral molecular markers and quantitative traits - to define useful conservation units. Six gene pools associated to distinct evolutionary histories were identified within the species using 12 microsatellites and 266 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, height and survival standing variation, their genetic control and plasticity were assessed in a multisite clonal common garden experiment (16,544 trees). We found high levels of quantitative genetic differentiation within previously defined neutral gene pools. Subsequent cluster analysis and post-hoc trait distribution comparisons allowed us to define ten genetically homogeneous population groups with high evolutionary potential. They constitute the minimum number of units to be represented in a maritime pine dynamic conservation program. Our results uphold that the identification of conservation units below the species level should account for key neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, especially in species with strong population structure and complex evolutionary histories. The environmental zonation approach currently used by the pan-European genetic conservation strategy for forest trees would be largely improved by gradually integrating molecular and quantitative trait information, as data become available.",10.5061/dryad.c289v,Cuantitative genetics|Nuclear microsatellites|Phenotypic plasticity|SNPs|Conservation genetics|Dynamic conservation,University of Lausanne|INIA-CIFOR|BIOGECO|Department of Ecology and Evolution|Bioversity International|INRA|Sustainable Forest Management Research Institute|University of Valladolid-INIA|Department of Forest Ecology and Genetics|Forest Research Centre|University of Bordeaux,Pinus pinaster Ait.,,2016-04-20,DRYAD,Data from: Capturing neutral and adaptive genetic diversity for conservation in a highly structured tree species,,

This combined FE-SBI approach captures the benefits of finite elements in modelling problems with nonlinearities, as well as the computational superiority of SBI. The domain truncation enabled by this scheme allows us to utilize high-resolution finite elements discretization to capture inhomogeneities or complexities that may exist in a narrow region surrounding the fault. Combined with an adaptive time stepping algorithm, this framework opens new opportunities for modeling earthquake cycles with high-resolution fault zone physics. In this initial study, we consider a two dimensional (2-D) anti-plane model with a vertical strike-slip fault governed by rate and state friction in the quasi-dynamic limit under the radiation damping approximation. The proposed approach is first verified using the benchmark problem BP-1 from the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) sequence of earthquake and aseismic slip (SEAS) community verification effort. The computational framework is then utilized to model the earthquake sequence and aseismic slip of a fault embedded within a low-velocity fault zone (LVFZ) with different widths and compliance levels. Our results indicate that sufficiently compliant LVFZs contribute to the emergence of sub-surface events that fail to penetrate to the free surface and may experience earthquake clusters with nonuniform inter-seismic time. Furthermore, the LVFZ leads to slip rate amplification relative to the homogeneous elastic case. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding earthquake complexity as an interplay of fault friction and bulk heterogeneities. The complete work consists of all files listed below.

Primitively eusocial bumblebees are uniquely placed to illuminate the evolution of highly eusocial insect societies. Bumblebees are also invaluable natural and agricultural pollinators, and there is widespread concern over recent population declines in some species. High-quality genomic data will inform key aspects of bumblebee biology, including susceptibility to implicated population viability threats. Results: We report the high quality draft genome sequences of Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, two ecologically dominant bumblebees and widely utilized study species. Comparing these new genomes to those of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera and other Hymenoptera, we identify deeply conserved similarities, as well as novelties key to the biology of these organisms. Some honeybee genome features thought to underpin advanced eusociality are also present in bumblebees, indicating an earlier evolution in the bee lineage. Xenobiotic detoxification and immune genes are similarly depauperate in bumblebees and honeybees, and multiple categories of genes linked to social organization, including development and behavior, show high conservation. Key differences identified include a bias in bumblebee chemoreception towards gustation from olfaction, and striking differences in microRNAs, potentially responsible for gene regulation underlying social and other traits. Conclusions: These two bumblebee genomes provide a foundation for post-genomic research on these key pollinators and insect societies. Overall, gene repertoires suggest that the route to advanced eusociality in bees was mediated by many small changes in many genes and processes, and not by notable expansion or depauperation.",10.5061/dryad.52hj2,,"Center for Functional and Comparative Insect Genomics|Departamento de Genética|Laboratory of Zoophysiology|Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)|University Hospital Halle (Saale)|Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering|Computational Evolution|Oxford Brookes University|Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology|Experimental Ecology|Departamento de Tecnologia|Carl R.

To date, most plant circadian clock studies have relied on diurnal transcriptome changes to elucidate molecular connections between the circadian clock and observable phenotypes in wild-type plants. Here, we have integrated RNA-sequencing and protein mass spectrometry data to comparatively analyse the lhycca1, prr7prr9, gi and toc1 circadian clock mutant rosette at the end of day and end of night. Each mutant affects specific sets of genes and proteins, suggesting that the circadian clock regulation is modular. Furthermore, each circadian clock mutant maintains its own dynamically fluctuating transcriptome and proteome profile specific to subcellular compartments. Most of the measured protein levels do not correlate with changes in their corresponding transcripts. Transcripts and proteins that have coordinated changes in abundance are enriched for carbohydrate- and cold-responsive genes. Transcriptome changes in all four circadian clock mutants also affect genes encoding starch degradation enzymes, transcription factors and protein kinases. The comprehensive transcriptome and proteome datasets demonstrate that future system-driven research of the circadian clock requires multi-level experimental approaches. Our work also shows that further work is needed to elucidate the roles of post-translational modifications and protein degradation in the regulation of clock-related processes.",10.6084/m9.figshare.4653475,Systems Biology,,,,2017-01-01,figshare.ars,Table S15 from Parallel analysis of Arabidopsis circadian clock mutants reveals different scales of transcriptome and proteome regulation,,

Primitively eusocial bumblebees are uniquely placed to illuminate the evolution of highly eusocial insect societies. Bumblebees are also invaluable natural and agricultural pollinators, and there is widespread concern over recent population declines in some species. High-quality genomic data will inform key aspects of bumblebee biology, including susceptibility to implicated population viability threats. Results: We report the high quality draft genome sequences of Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, two ecologically dominant bumblebees and widely utilized study species. Comparing these new genomes to those of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera and other Hymenoptera, we identify deeply conserved similarities, as well as novelties key to the biology of these organisms. Some honeybee genome features thought to underpin advanced eusociality are also present in bumblebees, indicating an earlier evolution in the bee lineage. Xenobiotic detoxification and immune genes are similarly depauperate in bumblebees and honeybees, and multiple categories of genes linked to social organization, including development and behavior, show high conservation. Key differences identified include a bias in bumblebee chemoreception towards gustation from olfaction, and striking differences in microRNAs, potentially responsible for gene regulation underlying social and other traits. Conclusions: These two bumblebee genomes provide a foundation for post-genomic research on these key pollinators and insect societies. Overall, gene repertoires suggest that the route to advanced eusociality in bees was mediated by many small changes in many genes and processes, and not by notable expansion or depauperation.",10.5061/dryad.52hj2,,"Center for Functional and Comparative Insect Genomics|Departamento de Genética|Laboratory of Zoophysiology|Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)|University Hospital Halle (Saale)|Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering|Computational Evolution|Oxford Brookes University|Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology|Experimental Ecology|Departamento de Tecnologia|Carl R.

The aim of this study was to carry out a preliminary epidemiological investigation of tuberculosis (TB) cases in Rome. Methods: A total of 232 Mtb isolates, collected from new or previously treated patients, admitted between 2008 and 2014 at 2 hospital settings in Rome with a diagnosis of TB, were analyzed by spoligotyping and analyzing 24 variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit (MIRU) loci. The SITVIT2 database and the MIRU-VNTRplus web applications were used to identify the strain genotypes and to generate phylogenetic trees. Results: Based on the position on the phylogenetic tree, 97.4% of the strains were associated with 1 of the 7 main lineages. The Euro-American lineage was the most commonly represented (81.9%) within both Italian and foreign-born populations, although all main lineages were present. The highest frequency of drug-resistant strains was found among the East-Asian lineage (Beijing genotype) isolated from foreign-born patients. Conclusions: Dynamics of TB transmission in Rome indicate recent spread of Mtb strains belonging to phylogeographic lineages and clades usually found in countries and geographic areas with a high incidence of TB, similarly to what is observed in most metropolitan areas in Western Europe.

,"Zhou, Wu",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t5pv8,TABULAR_DATA|DATASET,2017-08-21,"Metastasis is a multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from their primary site and form secondary tumors at a distant site. The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary tumor and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary tumor, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets Git2 and Cyth3, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating tumor cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast tumors and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.",10.5061/dryad.t5pv8,,Chinese Academy of Sciences|Department of Laboratory Animal Science|Ningbo Institute of Medical Sciences|Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences|Division of Drugs and Pharmacology|Department of Medicine|Laboratory of Medicine|Institute for Nutritional Sciences|Lishui University|Tianjin Medical University|People's Hospital of Lishui City|College of Medicine and Health,,,2017-08-21,DRYAD,Data from: The lncRNA H19 mediates breast cancer cell plasticity during EMT and MET plasticity by differentially sponging miR-200b/c and let-7b,,

Population genetic variability and the genetic structure of C. includens populations were evaluated by using ISSR markers with samples from the major soybean producing regions in Brazil in the growing seasons 2011/2012. Seven different primers were applied for population characterization of the molecular variability and genetic structure of 8 soybean looper populations from 8 states of Brazil. The seven ISSR loci generated 247 bands in 246 individuals of C. includens sampled. The expected heterozygosity (HE) in the populations varied between 0.093 and 0.106, while the overall HE was 0.099, indicating low genetic diversity. The analysis of molecular variance indicated that 98% of the variability was expressed among individuals within populations (FST = 0.021, p = 0.001). The low level of polymorphism over all populations, the high levels of gene flow, and the low genetic structure are indicatives of the exchange of genetic information between the different sampled regions. Population structuring suggests the presence of two major groups which do not correlate with their geographic sampling location in Brazil. These results may indicate recent recolonization of C. includens in Brazil or migration patterns following source-sink dynamics. Furthermore, the presence of two groups within C. includens suggests that a study on development of resistance or any other genetic-based trait needs to be evaluated on both groups, and pest management in soybean fields should be aware that differences may come to the control strategies they use.",10.5061/dryad.s64jp,Gene flow|Pest management|Genetic polymorphism|Population analysis|Soybean lopper|Inter Simple Sequence Repeat,"Laboratory of Integrated Pest Management, Department of Crop Protection, Federal University of Santa Maria|Department of Crop Protection, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University",Chrysodeixis includens|Plusiinae|Noctuidae,,2015-04-14,DRYAD,"Data from: Molecular variability and genetic structure of Chrysodeixis includens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), an important soybean defoliator in Brazil",,

Background
Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but its overall association with health remains complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. With our comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older.

Methods
Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs. We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health",10.17632/5thy2mcwn7.6,Research Article,University of Washington Department of Global Health,Research Article,,2018-10-24,MENDELEY_DATA,"Data for Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016",article,6

Of the five agricultural systems practised by fungus‐growing ants, higher‐attine agriculture, of which leaf‐cutter agriculture is a derived subset, remains poorly understood despite its relevance to ecosystem function and human agriculture across the Neotropics and parts of North America. Among the ants practising higher‐attine agriculture, the genus Trachymyrmex Forel, as currently defined, shares most‐recent common ancestors with both the leaf‐cutter ants and the higher‐attine genera Sericomyrmex Mayr and Xerolitor Sosa‐Calvo et al. Although previous molecular‐phylogenetic studies have suggested that Trachymyrmex is a paraphyletic grade, until now insufficient taxon sampling has prevented a full investigation of the evolutionary history of this group and limited the possibility of resolving its taxonomy. Here we describe the results of phylogenetic analyses of 38 Trachymyrmex species, including 27 of the 49 described species and at least 11 new species, using four nuclear markers, as well as phylogenetic analyses of the fungi cultivated by 23 species of Trachymyrmex using two markers. We generated new genetic data for 112 ants (402 new gene sequences) and 95 fungi (153 new gene sequences). Our results corroborate previous findings that Trachymyrmex, as currently defined, is paraphyletic. We propose recognizing two new genera, Mycetomoellerius gen.n. and Paratrachymyrmex gen.n., and restricting the continued use of Trachymyrmex to the clade of nine largely North American species that contains the type species [Trachymyrmex septentrionalis (McCook)] and that is the sister group of the leaf‐cutting ants. Our fungal cultivar phylogeny generally corroborates previously observed broad patterns of ant–fungus association, but it also reveals further violations of those patterns. Higher‐attine fungi are divided into two groups: (i) the single species Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Möller); and (ii) its sister clade, consisting of multiple species, recently referred to as Leucoagaricus Singer ‘clade B’. Our phylogeny indicates that, although most non‐leaf‐cutting higher‐attine ants typically cultivate species in clade B, some species cultivate L. gongylophorus, whereas still others cultivate fungi typically associated with lower‐attine agriculture. This indicates that the attine agricultural systems, which are currently defined by associations between ants and fungi, are not entirely congruent with ant and fungal phylogenies.

,"Vučković, Marta",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3541,DATASET,,"Restricted until 19 Nov. 2012. The mammalian brain is a remarkable organ that continues to fascinate biologists with its ability to undergo experience-dependent adaptations, and this property is preserved throughout the life. Brain plasticity on the molecular and cellular level within neurons is thought to occur in response to neuronal activity, continuously changing the strength of synapses and thus influencing the connections between neurons. Synapses are weakened or strengthened in response to specific patterns of neuronal activity. The underlying mechanism of synaptic plasticity is thought to consist of the regulated release of neurotransmitters (chemical mediators of neuronal communication) from the presynaptic side, and changes in the expression levels and availability of corresponding receptors located predominantly on the postsynaptic side of the synapse.  Numerous studies over the past three decades have focused on elucidating the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity, with the goal of better understanding the link between transient changes in neuronal activity in response to experience, and short- and long-term changes in brain circuitry that underlie learning, memory and adaptive behavior. However, many key questions remain unresolved.  The results of research efforts presented in this dissertation represent a modest contribution to our increasing knowledge of experience-dependent brain plasticity and its relevance to human health.; Naturally, the most dramatic changes in the complexity and functionality of any brain region happen during development, when a single sheet of precursor cells gives rise to a complex organ with multiple types of neurons, communicating through billions of connections and using different types of chemical messengers, the neurotransmitters. At the other end of life, during aging and the neurodegenerative processes, the brain undergoes a different kind of plasticity, a dynamic process that effectively breaks connections between neurons, and severely impairs numerous brain functions. Looking from the outside, these two periods of life seem to initiate the most dramatic and highly dynamic of all the changes in the brain as they are evident through striking changes in behavior or by the gain or the loss of functions. However, throughout the healthy adult life, more subtle, yet important plastic changes happen in the brain at both the molecular and cellular level, enabling animals and humans to learn new motor skills or a new language and remember places and people they meet. Emerging new research suggests that dynamics in the brain go beyond learning processes. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that daily experiences, stress, physical activity, diet, and lifestyle changes are all factors that cause subtle plastic changes in the brain, bringing both positive and negative consequences to overall brain function. In this dissertation, I investigated adult brain plasticity in health and disease. For my research I used the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. This animal model enabled me to investigate plastic changes in the brain on the molecular and cellular level and also provided me with a simple model of behavioral changes. The first study of this dissertation was designed to investigate the plasticity in the serotonin system in different brain regions following a neurotoxic brain injury resulting in severe loss of dopamine (presented in Chapter 2).; Serotonin is a chemical used by different brain regions for communication between neurons. Through its signaling in the frontal cortex, amygdala and midbrain, serotonin controls complex behaviors such as fear response and memory formation, and its imbalance is closely linked to human psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. In the study presented in Chapter 2, severe dopamine depletion caused loss of serotonin in multiple brain regions in the mice treated with MPTP, and this neurotransmitter imbalance caused memory impairments, but not depression and anxiety-like behaviors. Three other studies in this dissertation focused on investigating experience-driven neuroplasticity in the adult mouse brain. Specifically, in Chapter 3, my studies focused on plastic changes in expression of dopamine receptor D2 in the striatum of mice lesioned with MPTP and exposed to daily treadmill exercise. Dopamine receptors are gates of dopamine signaling in the brain and without them the neurotransmitter cannot be used for communication between neurons. Results presented in Chapter 3 indicate that daily treadmill exercise for 6 weeks increases expression of dopamine receptor D2 in the striatum of mice. This finding was also confirmed using in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of live mice. Using the same experimental model in Chapter 4, I examined the plastic changes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the principal neurons in the striatum, focusing on the analysis of their complex morphology. The analysis showed that 6 weeks of treadmill exercise increased the spine density on MSNs in the dorsolateral striatum, and this increase was observed in both control and MPTP-lesioned mice but was more pronounced in the lesioned mice. This finding was supported by electron microscopy analysis of synapse number, which showed significant increase in response to treadmill exercise.; I investigated this phenomenon further in Chapter 5 by focusing on a subset of MSNs, those that are part of the striatal indirect pathway and predominantly express dopamine D2 receptors. This study used a transgenic mouse model that was engineered to allow direct visualization of the indirect pathway MSNs in the mouse brain using the fluorescent microscope. Results of this study showed that spine density changes on MSNs in response to exercise occur in indirect pathway neurons and future analysis will investigate if these changes are restricted to this striatal pathway or if they also occur in direct pathway MSNs. Analysis of glutamate AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) receptor composition in indirect pathway MSNs showed that treadmill exercise increased expression levels of the GluR2 subunit of this receptor in both control and MPTP lesioned mice. Electrophysiological recordings support these findings. Subunit composition of glutamate AMPA receptors is critical for experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in multiple brain regions, including the striatum. Modulation of AMPA receptor subunit composition through treadmill exercise training could be a part of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the benefits of exercise on the brain in both healthy individuals and people affected with PD.; Taken together, the results of the studies presented in this dissertation contribute to our knowledge and understanding of adult brain plasticity in health and disease. In addition, studies in this dissertation contribute to our better understanding of animal models of human diseases.",10.25549/usctheses-m3541,Neuroscience|animal models|basal ganglia|Parkinson's disease|exercise|MPTP|dopamine|brain plasticity,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,"Neuroplasticity of the basal ganglia in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease",,

Identification of protein interactions is a major goal in molecular biology, but biochemical methods, although improving, remain limited in coverage and accuracy. Whereas computational predictions can guide biochemical experiments, low validation rates of predictions remain a major limitation. Here, we investigated computational methods in the prediction of a specific type of interaction, the inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors. Proteases generate thousands of proteoforms that dynamically shape the functional state of proteomes. Despite the important regulatory role of proteases, knowledge of their inhibitors remains largely incomplete with the vast majority of proteases lacking an annotated inhibitor. To link inhibitors to their target proteases on a large scale, we applied computational methods to predict inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors based on complementary data including coexpression, phylogenetic similarity, structural information, co-annotation, and colocalization, and also surveyed general protein interaction networks for potential inhibitory interactions. In testing nine predicted interactions biochemically, we validated the inhibition of kallikrein 5 by serpin B12. Despite the use of a wide array of complementary data, we found a high false positive rate of computational predictions in biochemical follow-up. Based on a protease-specific definition of true negatives derived from the biochemical classification of proteases and inhibitors, we analyzed prediction accuracy of individual features. Thereby we identified feature-specific limitations, which also affected general protein interaction prediction methods. Interestingly, proteases were often not coexpressed with most of their functional inhibitors, contrary to what is commonly assumed and extrapolated predominantly from cell culture experiments. Predictions of inhibitory interactions were indeed more challenging than predictions of non-proteolytic and non-inhibitory interactions. In summary, we describe a novel and well-defined but difficult protein interaction prediction task, and thereby highlight limitations of computational interaction prediction methods.",10.5683/sp2/hvuiyz,,,,,2019-01-01,cisti.osp,Protease-inhibitor interaction predictions: Lessons on the complexity of protein-protein interactions,,

Gene mutations of enamel proteases were found to cause amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a hereditary disease affecting dental enamel. Two types of enamel proteases have been previously identified and reported to cleave amelogenin. However, the molecular mechanisms and function of enamel proteases during amelogenesis still remains unclear. I designed a series of in vitro experiments to systematically study the function of enamel proteases on amelogenin processing, assembly and interactions between amelogenin and apatite following proteolytic activities.; Methods and materials: Three amelogenin proteins were used: recombinant full length pig amelogenin (rP172), recombinant homolog of its major cleavage product (rP148), and a native amelogenin lacking both N- and C-termini (13k). Recombinant pig MMP20 (rpMMP20) and recombinant human kallikrein 4 (rhKLK4) were incubated with each of these three amelogenins with and without HAP crystals. Proteolytic products were detected by SDS-PAGE, HPLC, and mass spectrometry. Assembly properties of these three amelogenins and their proteolytic products were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Affinity of thethree amelogenins to apatite was systematically evaluated by means of Langmuir model for protein adsorption.; Results: rpMMP20 cleaved rP172 more efficiently than it cleaved rP148 and it didn't process the ""13k"". rhKLK4 processed all of the above with an exponential reduction. These three amelogenins had different assembly properties. The cleavage of Cterminus led to aggregation of amelogenin; and the N-terminal cleavage resulted in the dis-assembly of amelogenin molecules. During proteolysis amelogenin substrates had higher binding affinity to HAP than their proteolytic products. HAP did not change the cleavage pattern of amelogenin by proteases. Comparative adsorption isotherms indicated the binding affinity of amelogenins in the order, rP172&gt;rP148&gt;13k. Conclusions: Processing of amelogenin by MMP20 and KLK-4 is stepwise, progressive, and with different patterns. Enamel proteinases cause alterations of amelogenin assembly with consequence of dis-assembly. Cleavages of C- and N-termini of amelogenin reduce its apatite binding affinity. We suggest that such controlled proteolysis will dictate the function of amelogenin in controlling crystal morphology and orientation.",10.25549/usctheses-m1063,apatite|self-assembly|KLK4|enamel|Biology|amelogenin|MMP20,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Enamelysin (MMP20) and Kallikrein 4 (KLK4) functions during enamel formation,,

Tubulins are dynamic proteins which assemble into polymers called microtubules to participate in critical roles throughout the cell such as cytoskeletal stability, intracellular transport, and mitosis. Given their physiological importance, these native protein polymers have been clinically exploited as targets for small molecule drugs capable of interfering with the microtubule network. Elastin‐like polypeptides (ELPs), meanwhile, constitute a genetically engineered class of ‘protein polymers’ derived from human tropoelastin. They exhibit a reversible phase separation whereby samples remain soluble below a transition temperature (Tₜ) but form amorphous coacervates above Tₜ. ELPs phase behavior has many possible applications in purification and nanoassembly which can be further expanded by fusing this thermoresponsive moiety to native proteins. Recombinant synthesis additionally affords precise control over an ELP fusion protein’s architecture and molecular weight, resulting in functionalized protein polymers with uniform physicochemical properties suited to the design of tools relevant to nanomedicine and synthetic biology. The studies featured within this dissertation therefore explore tubulin‐ELP fusion proteins as multifunctional tools with three broad applications—namely, as colchicine nanocarriers, tubulin‐based purification tools, and intracellular switches. Although unsuccessful as colchicine nanocarriers, these ELP‐based tools have potentiated a non‐chromatographic method for the purification of recombinantly expressed tubulins and offer the possibility of thermally regulating microtubule dynamics within an intracellular milieu.",10.25549/usctheses-c89-139861,Pharmaceutical Sciences|synthetic biology|elastin‐like polypeptides|tubulin|colchicine|nanomedicine|drug delivery|microtubules|protein polymers|biophysics,,,,2019-01-01,usc.dl,Tubulin-based fusion proteins as multifunctional tools,,

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (76o 30� , 39o 15� and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (76o 30� , 39o 15� and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (76o 30� , 39o 15� and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

          One-meter soil cores were taken to evaluate soil texture, bulk density, carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, microbial respiration, potential net nitrogen mineralization, potential net nitrification  and inorganic nitrogen pools in 32 residential home lawns that differed by previous land use and age, but had similar soil types.  These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  
      
      
          Purpose:  
      
      
          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    
      
      
          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  
      
      
          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.
      
      
          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  
      
      
          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  
      
      
          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).
      
      
          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. 
      
      
          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  
      
      
          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  
      
      
          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.

The community of microbes associated with animals can be dynamic depending on the local environment, and factors that influence the composition of the microbiome are essential to our understanding of how microbes may influence the biology of their animal hosts. Regularly repeated changes in the environment, such as diel lighting, can result in two different organismal responses: a direct response to the presence and absence of exogenous light and endogenous rhythms resulting from a molecular circadian clock, both of which can influence the associated microbiota. Here, we report how diel lighting and a potential circadian clock impacts the diversity and relative abundance of bacteria in the model cnidarian Nematostella vectensis using an amplicon-based sequencing approach. Comparisons of bacterial communities associated with anemones cultured in constant darkness and in light:dark conditions revealed that individuals entrained in the dark had a more diverse microbiota. Overall community composition showed little variation over a 24-hour period in either treatment; however, abundances of individual bacterial OTUs showed significant cycling in each treatment. A comparative analysis of genes involved in the innate immune system of cnidarians showed differential expression between lighting conditions in N. vectensis, with significant up-regulation during long-term darkness for a subset of genes. Together, our studies support a hypothesis that the bacterial community associated with this species is relatively stable under diel light conditions when compared with static conditions and that particular bacterial members may have time-dependent abundance that coincides with the diel photoperiod in an otherwise stable community.",10.5061/dryad.hf33q77,diel|cnidarian|photoperiod|microbiome,,Nematostella vectensis,,2019-08-26,DRYAD,Data from: Diel patterning in the bacterial community associated with the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis,,

It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active matter systems may be optimized to produce highly dissipative dynamical states, hence, leading to spontaneous emergence of more ordered states. This interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent one of the most salient examples of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of dissipa- tion optimization. In order to start addressing this question using detailed computational modeling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform, which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical re- actions and relaxation of mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. This is done by computing precise changes in Gibbs free energy accompanying chemical reactions using a novel formula, and through detailed calculations of instantaneous values of the system’s mechanical energy. We validate our approach with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self- organization of small disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we do not observe that spontaneous network reorganizations lead to increases in the total dissipation rate as predicted by the dissipation- driven adaptation hypothesis mentioned above. However, whether such a principle operates in more general, more complex cytoskeletal networks remains to be investigated.,",10.13016/t8oa-9qra,"Dissipation, Actomyosin Networks, Actin Treadmilling, Network Percolation, Mean-Field Modeling, Active Matter",,,,2019-01-01,umd.lib,Quantifying Dissipation in Actomyosin Networks,,

Big brown bats are common across North America and employ a flexible foraging strategy over water, dense forests, forest edges and rural and urban settings. Despite this generalist use of habitat, they are paradoxically characterized as beetle specialists. However, hard carapaces may preferentially survive digestion leading to over-representation during morphological analysis of diet. This specialization has not been evaluated independently using molecular analysis and species-level identification of prey. We used next-generation sequencing to assess the diet of big brown bats. Beetles were consumed in the highest frequency but Lepidoptera species richness was highest among identified prey. The consumption of species showed strong seasonal and annual variation. While Coleoptera consumption varied, Lepidoptera and Ephemeroptera were relatively constant dietary components. Dietary diversity increased in late summer when insect diversity decreases. Our results indicate that big brown bats are dietary generalists and, while beetles are an important component of the diet, Lepidoptera are equally important, and Lepidoptera and Ephemeroptera are the only stable prey resource exploited. As resources become limited, big brown bats may respond by increasing the species richness of prey and thus their connectedness in the ecosystem. This characterization of diet corresponds well with a generalist approach to foraging, making them an important species in encouraging and maintaining ecosystem stability.",10.5061/dryad.t30bh,Ecosystem Services|insectivores|Species Interactions|molecular diet analysis|Diet Analysis|Mammals,"Cardiff School of Biosciences, Sir Martin Evans Building|School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London|Department of Biology, Western University",Eptesicus fuscus,,2013-09-25,DRYAD,Data from: An inordinate fondness for beetles?

The year-round circulation of H3N2 viruses and the endemicity of H5N1 virus in Indonesia are of serious concern, because the two viruses may reeassort to generate strains with pandemic potential. The consideration of the tropics as the influenza reservoir where viral genetic and antigenic diversity are continually generated and reintroduced into temperate countries makes the study of influenza virus evolution in Indonesia is essential. As only limited data are available, there is an urgent need to monitor the phylodynamic and evolutionary patterns, and the genetic characteristics of the influenza A/H3N2 virus in Indonesia. It is also necessary to evaluate how mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) gene might impact on influenza vaccine efficacy.

It was also revealed that H3N2 virus had circulated approximately one year before the sampling dates. Major mutations at the antigenic sites A and B of HA protein were identified, while relatively conserved sequences were found at the catalytic sites of NA protein.

Different methodologies have been employed principally to analyze the temporal dynamics of the niche and specially to test for the presence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Menonvillea, a genus of Brassicaceae including 24 species, is distributed primarily along the Andes of Argentina and Chile, with some taxa growing in southern Patagonia and others in the Atacama Desert and the Chilean Matorral. The genus is highly diversified morphologically but also presents a remarkably wide ecological range, growing from the high Andean elevations, to the dry coastal deserts in Chile, or the Patagonia Steppe in Argentina. In this study, we used molecular phylogenies together with climatic data to study climatic niche evolution in the genus. The results show that the main climatic niche shifts in Menonvillea occurred between the sections Cuneata-Scapigera and sect. Menonvillea throughout the Mid-Late Miocene, and associated with the two main geographical distribution centers of the genus: the highlands of the central-southern Andes and the Atacama Desert-Chilean Matorral, respectively. Climatic niches in these lineages were mainly differentiated by the aridity and potential evapotranspiration, the minimum temperatures of the coldest month, and the temperature annual range and seasonality. Niche evolution in Menonvillea deviated from a Brownian motion process, with most of the climatic dimension best-fitting to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of multiple adaptive peaks. Our results also indicated that higher aridity levels and lower annual temperature ranges were associated with the evolution of the annual habit, as exemplified by the distribution of sect. Menonvillea. Finally, the results suggested that climatic niche evolution in Menonvillea exhibited some degree of phylogenetic niche conservatism, fundamentally within the two main lineages (sect.

A prerequisite of accurate quantifications of gases in sediments is to preserve pressure and temperature close to the in situ conditions during recovery. Here we introduce two new sediment coring devices that allow for the recovery of near-surface gas- and gas-hydrate-bearing sediments and subsequent investigations using several different techniques such as visualisation by computerized tomography, quantitative degassing, and sediment and porewater analyses. The first coring tool, the Multiple Autoclave Corer (MAC), resembles a standard multiple corer in terms of applications, size and core length of about 55 cm. The second tool, the Dynamic Autoclave Piston Corer (DAPC), is similar to a piston corer in application and size and enables one to take cores of up to 2.5 m length. Both focus on the investigation of near-surface sediments, which are most strongly affected by changes in bottom-water temperature and hydrostatic pressure, which in turn influence continental slope stability. Some results from recent offshore applications show the potential of these tools.

To learn how viruses respond to this pressure, we disrupted the genetic network of Escherichia coli to inhibit replication of its virus, bacteriophage lambda, and then observed how λ evolved to compensate. We deleted E. coli's dnaJ gene, which lambda uses to initiate DNA replication. Lambda partially restored its ability to reproduce with just two adaptive mutations associated with genes J and S. The location of the mutations was unexpected because they were not in genes that directly interact with DnaJ, rather they affected seemingly unrelated life history traits. A nonsynonymous J mutation increased λ’s adsorption rate and an S regulatory mutation delayed lysis timing. λ also recovered some of its reproductive potential through intracellular mutualism. This study offers two important lessons: first, viruses can rapidly adapt to disruptive changes in their host's genetic network. Second, organisms can employ mechanisms thought to operate at the population scale, such as evolution of life history traits and social interactions, in order to overcome hurdles at the molecular level.

There were several motivations for this study. First, bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) is the most commonly used pro-inflammatory stimulus for microglia, both in vitro and in vivo; however, pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα) rather than LPS will be encountered with sterile CNS damage and disease. We lack direct comparisons of responses between LPS and such cytokines. Second, while transcriptional profiling is providing substantial data on microglial responses to LPS, these studies mainly use mouse cells and models, and there is increasing evidence that responses of rat microglia can differ. Third, the cytokine milieu is dynamic after acute CNS damage, and an important question in microglial biology is: How malleable are their responses? There are very few studies of effects of resolving cytokines, particularly for rat microglia, and much of the work has focused on pro-inflammatory outcomes. Here, we first exposed primary rat microglia to LPS or to IFNγ+TNFα (I+T) and compared hallmark functional (nitric oxide production, migration) and molecular responses (almost 100 genes), including surface receptors that can be considered part of the sensome. Protein changes for exemplary molecules were also quantified: ARG1, CD206/MRC1, COX-2, iNOS, and PYK2. Despite some similarities, there were notable differences in responses to LPS and I+T. For instance, LPS often evoked higher pro-inflammatory gene expression and also increased several anti-inflammatory genes. Second, we compared the ability of two anti-inflammatory, resolving cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), to counteract responses to LPS and I+T. IL-4 was more effective after I+T than after LPS, and IL-10 was surprisingly ineffective after either stimulus. These results should prove useful in modeling microglial reactivity in vitro; and comparing transcriptional responses to sterile CNS inflammation in vivo.",10.5061/dryad.st860bt,Nanostring mRNA microglia inflammation|Sprague Dawley rat,,,,2018-07-24,DRYAD,"Data from: Microglia responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli (LPS, IFNγ+TNFα) and reprogramming by resolving cytokines (IL-4, IL-10)",,

The study was conducted in two consecutive seasons at four forest fragments embedded in contrasting (connected vs. isolated) landscapes. Interseasonal variation in the parental genetic structure of the seed rain was assessed through analysis of molecular variance, and paternal and maternal correlations and effective parental numbers were computed for different fragments and microhabitats (within fragments) using genetic kinship analysis. Temporal variation in the genetic structure of the dispersed seeds was higher for maternal gametes, reflecting a more temporally variable contribution of individual mother plants to the seed rain, as a potential consequence of masting and/or natural heterogeneity. Higher effective numbers of fathers than mothers were consistently observed in all studied forest fragments and microhabitats, the difference being more pronounced for connected than for isolated fragments.

,"Nakamura, Kyle J.",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-619869,DATASET,,"The struggle to contain and extinguish the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic, now in its 30th year, may represent the single greatest challenge faced by modern medical science.  Despite billions of dollars in research funding and the dedicated work of thousands of scientists and clinicians HIV/AIDS has already claimed over 25 million lives.  There are ~33 million people currently living with HIV and  ~2.7 million new infections occurred last year.  Approximately 2.1 million children are currently HIV+, the vast majority of who acquired the virus from their mothers.  While great strides have been made in the development of drugs to treat HIV infection, such medications are expensive and the majority of people who need them currently lack access.  Efforts at developing an HIV vaccine have met with almost relentless failure, and only one human trial has thus far produced modest positive results.  One of the greatest challenges facing HIV vaccine development is the incredible genetic heterogeneity of circulating viral strains, and HIVs ability to rapidly mutate in order to escape immune pressure. ❧ There is some hope.  HIV transmission is extremely inefficient, often resulting from the outgrowth of a single genetic variant.  This extreme genetic bottleneck implies the action of powerful selective forces, yet there is precious little data available on the genetic and functional properties of variants that successfully establish infection in a new host, and almost no data on how these selective criteria may vary by route of transmission.  An improved understanding of the selective forces acting on viral variants during transmission could open up new strategies to interfere with the process.  By answering the question “what defines a winner?” we can refine our approaches to specifically target the viral variants most capable of establishing chronic infection in a susceptible host. ❧ In this context, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) represents both an important medical and humanitarian concern, as well as a powerful system in which to study transmission dynamics.  Unlike other forms of transmission, MTCT allows unambiguous identification of the source donor.  Furthermore, MTCT involves three distinct, mutually exclusive, and serial exposures (in utero, during labor and delivery, and postnatally by breastfeeding).  By studying the early-transmitted virus from the infected infants, and comparing those variants to the virus circulating in the chronically infected mothers, we can identify the specific features selected for during transmission and how that selection may vary by exposure.  This knowledge will, in turn, help us unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV transmission, and ultimately provide new targets for intervention. ❧ In our study we explore the genotypic and phenotypic selection that occurs during transmission of HIV from mother to child.  We define a unique ‘molecular signature’ for virus transmitted in utero and by breastfeeding.  This study represents, to our knowledge, the first description of transmission-route-specific selection in HIV; and as such permanently alters the way in which MTCT should be approached.  We also describe a series of HIV infected subjects harboring antibody resistant variants previously thought to be extremely rare, but which appear to occur with greater frequency in pregnant women and their infected offspring.  The identification and characterization of these variants has implications for both vaccine development and our understanding of the structure/function of HIV’s envelope protein.",10.25549/usctheses-c127-619869,Systems Biology and Disease|HIV|AIDS|mother-to-child transmission,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Route-specific selection during mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1,,

They, therefore, play a critical role in the marine carbon cycle.
In this study, we set out to identify the roles played by individual heterotrophic bacteria in the degradation of high molecular weight polysaccharides. At five sites in the Atlantic Ocean, we investigated the processing of organic matter in microbial communities by tracking the changes in community composition (fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), 16S rRNA tag sequencing) in substrate incubation using a defined concentration of a known fluorescently labelled polysaccharide (FLA-laminarin, FLA-xylan, and FLA-chondroitin sulfate). Additionally, we tracked the dynamics of substrate processing (selfish uptake and extracellular hydrolysis) within the microbial communities between sites.
We found that the same substrate was processed in different ways by different members of a pelagic microbial community which points to significant follow-on effects for carbon cycling.

Yet, the functional implication of the UPP in tissue homeodynamics at the whole organism level and its potential cross-talk with other proteostatic or mitostatic modules are not well understood. We show here that knock down (KD) of proteasome subunits in Drosophila flies, induced, for most subunits, developmental lethality. Ubiquitous or tissue specific proteasome dysfunction triggered systemic proteome instability and activation of PN modules, including macroautophagy/autophagy, molecular chaperones and the antioxidant cncC (the fly ortholog of NFE2L2/Nrf2) pathway. Also, proteasome KD increased genomic instability, altered metabolic pathways and severely disrupted mitochondrial functionality, triggering a cncC-dependent upregulation of mitostatic genes and enhanced rates of mitophagy. Whereas, overexpression of key regulators of antioxidant responses (e.g., cncC or foxo) could not suppress the deleterious effects of proteasome dysfunction; these were alleviated in both larvae and adult flies by modulating mitochondrial dynamics towards increased fusion or by enhancing autophagy. Our findings reveal the extensive functional wiring of genomic, proteostatic and mitostatic modules in higher metazoans. Also, they support the notion that age-related increase of proteotoxic stress due to decreased UPP activity deregulates all aspects of cellular functionality being thus a driving force for most age-related diseases.

,"Oh, Jin Ho",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-631915,DATASET,,"Aberrations in DNA methylation patterns have been identified between “healthy” and “diseased” cells, especially in cancer cells and other cells exhibiting complex human syndromes, such as Fragile X syndrome, Praeder-Willi syndrome, ICF syndrome, etc. Improvements in recognizing these different methylation patterns could lead to breakthroughs in relevant disease diagnostics and prognostics. A great majority of methods currently available for assessing DNA methylation patterns focuses on molecular profiling of large volumes of cells and, thus, is not ideal for use in pathology, where understanding variations in methylation profiles of individual cells within a population is important. Although single cell profiling may be possible in newer generation microarray-based assays, sequencing of methylation patterns remains highly time-consuming and very costly, when applied in cell-by-cell fashion. Towards the ultimate goal of creating a high-throughput assay that could be used in translational medicine, imaging-based, quantitative, and cytometric analysis of DNA methylation patterns entitled “3-Dimensional Quantitative DNA Methylation Imaging (3D-qDMI)” has been developed. This dissertation investigates the feasibility of using such assay to delineate and quantify in situ global DNA methylation features, such as nuclear load and spatial distribution of methylated cytosine (MeC). ❧ 3D-qDMI entails highly specific immunofluorescence methods, high-resolution imaging via confocal laser-scanning microscopy, and dedicated software package designed to analyze fluorescence intensity patterns at both the cellular and population levels. Immunofluorescence staining of specimens is performed by monoclonal anti-MeC primary antibody, which has been shown to possess both the desired specificity and sensitivity needed for a DNA methylation assay. The specimens were counter-stained with DAPI, a non-specific dye, to visualize the inhomogeneous distribution of genomic DNA. The counter-stain establishes the baseline of spatial genomic density, which was then used to qualify and quantify MeC fluorescence. The stained specimens were imaged by high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy, which has a lateral resolution of ~ 150 nm and an axial resolution of ~ 500 nm for the conditions used in this dissertation. The images obtained were analyzed with automated and high-throughput software specifically developed to meet the needs of 3D-qDMI without compromising data reliability. The image analysis methods involve a pre-processing step to delineate nuclear regions of interest (ROIs) and three different analytical modules to assess both cellular-level topological co-distribution of DAPI and MeC signals and population-level homogeneity. Each of the novel analytical modules was validated using sets of images with explicitly known characteristics. These analytical modules work independent from each other and have been designed to be flexible, so that the end user has the options to choose which specific modules to run. ❧ 3D-qDMI was then tested for its ability to distinguish and discriminate cells based on their DNA methylation patterns, in cells with different proliferative capacities. Primary cells were cultured until replicative senescence was reached, while cancer cells were grown to provide sufficient samples, as necessary, to identify their growth rates. Separately, stress-induced premature senescence was studied via application of H₂O₂.  Results from these studies showed that as the proliferative capacity of cells decreased, global hypomethylation and chromatin re-organization were observed. Global hypomethylation could also be identified in cancer cells, but distinct differences could be observed between cancer cells and primary cells reaching senescence for various topological parameters used in 3D-qDMI. These results suggest that these differences could be utilized in discriminating primary cells populations from cancer cell populations. Overall, the results from these feasibility studies confirmed that an imaging-based assay can be utilized to discern DNA methylation patterns of different cells. ❧ This dissertation demonstrates that an advanced optical imaging-based assay can be used to assess DNA methylation patterns at both single cell-level and population-level. The results found through 3D-qDMI were on par with previously published findings from molecular-based assays. 3D-qDMI is not developed to replace molecular-based assays: the current methods as presented in this dissertation cannot identify which DNA sequences are methylated nor determine the absolute number of MeC residues in the genome. Instead, 3D-qDMI was developed to address the need for a high-throughput, cost-effective assay for DNA methylation for use in pathology. Unlike the commonly available cellular phenotyping methods for tumor cells in biopsy samples, which rely on a static, morphology-based evaluation by a trained physician, 3D-qDMI delivers a dynamic and activity-based picture of cells. Further studies and development of the methods presented in this dissertation should allow for the ability to distinguish “healthy” cells from “diseased” cells, which could drastically change how clinical pathology is current performed.",10.25549/usctheses-c127-631915,Biomedical Engineering|image processing|immunofluorescence assay|DNA methylation|epigenetics|3D-qDMI,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Investigation of epigenetics in cell populations using three-dimensional quantitative DNA methylation imaging,,
,"Lee, Jae Kyoo",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-662046,DATASET,,"The response of live cells to external stress is regulated and processed through complex and highly-interconnected time-dependent signaling networks. The essential task for the understanding of the regulatory mechanism(s) is thus to determine the temporal and spatial quantitative map of the time-evolving molecular states of the signaling network to enable building a physically reasonable and biologically meaningful model that not only describes the acquired data but also can generate testable hypotheses. Conventional approaches in biological science and bioengineering rely almost invariably on population-averaged measurements of usually a single biomarker at a limited number of fixed time points. The true trajectories of the dynamics of multiple biomarkers of the cellular response and their cell-to-cell variation are thus averaged over and masked. In turn this limits the reliability and scope of the model(s) built upon such measurements. To overcome these limitations, in this dissertation, we introduced and followed the new paradigm of measuring simultaneously in real-time indicators / biomarkers of multiple processes in a statistically large number of individual live cells from the same population under controlled stress over prolonged times. Such an approach, increasingly recognized in recent years as central to pursuing a systems perspective of biological processes, including those underlying disease, demanded the availability of appropriate experimental platform. Fortunately the Madhukar laboratory was embarked upon developing such a platform and this author could join Dr. Siyuan Lu in this effort. Thus a custom-designed high-throughput real-time live-cell imaging platform that allows optical imaging of multiple fluorescence biomarkers while also imaging morphological changes in a network of live cells was developed, tested, and applied to the study of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Specifically, the mitochondria-mediated (i.e. intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) line differentiated RGC-5, induced by elevated hydrostatic pressure is examined via simultaneous imaging of five features: the time-dependant concentration of (1) intracellular Ca2+, (2) caspase-3/7 activation, (3) phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, and the morphological changes of (4) cell body shrinkage and (5) neurite retraction. Simultaneous measurement of five features in apoptosis, and perhaps for any biological process, in a statistically large number of individual live cells under continuous stress is a first. It has enabled the following major findings for apoptosis: (1) resolving a controversy in the literature, the mechanism of the observed apoptotic morphological change of cell body shrinkage at the early stage can now be attributed to the ion channel activities regulating water efflux as evidenced by the strong temporal correlation between the early intracellular Ca2+ elevation and the cell body shrinkage; (2) the first quantitative evidence for significant cell-to-cell variation in the time interval between the onset of Ca2+ elevation at the early stage of apoptosis and the time of caspase-3/7 activation at the later stages of apoptosis and (3) the appearance of multiple stages in PS translocation from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, suggesting more than a single mechanism of PS translocation to be operative in RGC apoptosis under elevated pressure. ❧ The acquisition of data on the dynamics of five features is not only a first, equally significant, the acquired Ca2+ data have enabled, for the first time, the modeling and analysis of the role of [Ca2+] in apoptosis. Although Ca2+ dynamics in normal healthy cells under physiological conditions has been measured, modeled, and analyzed for quite some time, the model proposed and analyzed here is the first one for [Ca2+] dynamics during apoptosis. The physical model proposed is guided by the seminal work of Boehning et al. [Nat. Cell Biol. 5 (2003)] who showed the significance of the cytochrome c released by the mitochondria for impacting the free cytosolic [Ca2+] via its binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Specifically, the impact of cytochrome c binding to IP3R is modeled as a change in the IP3R opening probability expression employed by Mak et al. [PNAS, 95 (1998)] in the modeling of [Ca2+] dynamics in non-apoptotic cells. The model provides a qualitative understanding of the [Ca2+] dynamics in apoptosis for reasonable values of the parameters involved. ❧ As PS translocation gives rise to an increase in its concentration at the cell surface, we also carried out a unique study utilizing combined NSOM-AFM (Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy - Atomic force microscopy) that allowed simultaneous imaging of the 3-dimensional topography of the cell surface and the local density of PS as manifest in the fluorescence intensity of Annexin-V conjugated to the PS measured at the nanoscale beyond the diffraction limit. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient 0.69) between the geometrical height and the density of the PS on the surface of the RGC-5 cell membrane is found. It suggests that this may be Nature’s way of signaling for and enabling a means for effective binding of the associated receptors in phagocytes to the translocated PS in the apoptotic cell. ❧ To investigate the very origin of RGC apoptosis under elevated pressure, we undertook examination of the neurotrophin deprivation hypothesis—namely that the blockage of neurotrophin uptake/transport through axon induces apoptosis in RGCs under elevated pressure. This was carried out employing dye as well as QD-tagged neurotrophins and for cells cultured in custom-designed microfluidic chips that enable isolation of the cell soma and processes. This ensures unambiguous measurements of spatially separated uptake regions and axonal transport of the neurotrophins. For the uptake studies, the cells employed are the differentiated RGC-5 cell line whereas for the axonal transport studies only the neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells were employed as these provide mature axons (unlike RGC-5 neurites which are not sufficiently mature). Reduction in the number of neurotrophin uptaken into the differentiated RGC-5 cells and more neurotrophins localized in the neurites were found under the elevated pressure of 100 mmHg compared to the cells under no elevated pressure. The neurotrophin transport in the neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells revealed a typical stop-and-go behavior. This suggests that the elevated pressure not only inhibits the overall uptake of the neurotrophins into RGCs but also potentially the transport through neurites in RGCs, thus providing the first evidence supporting the neurotrophin deprivation hypothesis of apoptosis.",10.25549/usctheses-c127-662046,Biomedical Engineering|systems biology|single molecule imaging|mathematical modeling|apoptosis|live cell imaging|retinal ganglion cell|real-time dynamics,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Multi-marker real-time optical imaging of live cell population under controlled stress: apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells,,

Yet, the functional implication of the UPP in tissue homeodynamics at the whole organism level and its potential cross-talk with other proteostatic or mitostatic modules are not well understood. We show here that knock down (KD) of proteasome subunits in Drosophila flies, induced, for most subunits, developmental lethality. Ubiquitous or tissue specific proteasome dysfunction triggered systemic proteome instability and activation of PN modules, including macroautophagy/autophagy, molecular chaperones and the antioxidant cncC (the fly ortholog of NFE2L2/Nrf2) pathway. Also, proteasome KD increased genomic instability, altered metabolic pathways and severely disrupted mitochondrial functionality, triggering a cncC-dependent upregulation of mitostatic genes and enhanced rates of mitophagy. Whereas, overexpression of key regulators of antioxidant responses (e.g., cncC or foxo) could not suppress the deleterious effects of proteasome dysfunction; these were alleviated in both larvae and adult flies by modulating mitochondrial dynamics towards increased fusion or by enhancing autophagy. Our findings reveal the extensive functional wiring of genomic, proteostatic and mitostatic modules in higher metazoans. Also, they support the notion that age-related increase of proteotoxic stress due to decreased UPP activity deregulates all aspects of cellular functionality being thus a driving force for most age-related diseases.

Microhabitats in the soil – such as within and outside of aggregates, in the detritusphere, and/or in the rhizosphere – are considered to promote and preserve specific redox conditions. Yet our understanding of the relative effects of such microhabitats and their interactions on N2O production and consumption in soils is still incomplete. Therefore, we assessed the effect of aggregate size, buried leaf litter, and plant–soil interactions on the occurrence of enhanced N2O emissions under simulated flooding/drying conditions in a mesocosm experiment. We used two model soils with equivalent structure and texture, comprising macroaggregates (4000–250 µm) or microaggregates (&lt;250 µm) from a N-rich floodplain soil. These model soils were planted with basket willow (Salix viminalis L.), mixed with leaf litter or left unamended. After 48 h of flooding, a period of enhanced N2O emissions occurred in all treatments. The unamended model soils with macroaggregates emitted significantly more N2O during this period than those with microaggregates. Litter addition modulated the temporal pattern of the N2O emission, leading to short-term peaks of high N2O fluxes at the beginning of the period of enhanced N2O emission. The presence of S. viminalis strongly suppressed the N2O emission from the macroaggregate model soil, masking any aggregate-size effect. Integration of the flux data with data on soil bulk density, moisture, redox potential and soil solution composition suggest that macroaggregates provided more favourable conditions for spatially coupled nitrification–denitrification, which are particularly conducive to net N2O production. The local increase in organic carbon in the detritusphere appears to first stimulate N2O emissions; but ultimately, respiration of the surplus organic matter shifts the system towards redox conditions where N2O reduction to N2 dominates. Similarly, the low emission rates in the planted soils can be best explained by root exudation of low-molecular-weight organic substances supporting complete denitrification in the anoxic zones, but also by the inhibition of denitrification in the zone, where rhizosphere aeration takes place. Together, our experiments highlight the importance of microhabitat formation in regulating oxygen (O2) content and the completeness of denitrification in soils during drying after saturation. Moreover, they will help to better predict the conditions under which hot spots, and “hot moments”, of enhanced N2O emissions are most likely to occur in hydrologically dynamic soil systems like floodplain soils.",10.5061/dryad.50g8322,floodplain soils|litter|redox potentials|nitrous oxide|salix viminalis|aggregate size|emission patterns,,,,2018-11-28,DRYAD,"Data from: Alteration of nitrous oxide emissions from floodplain soils by aggregate size, litter accumulation and plant–soil interactions",,

,"Shojaei, Hasan",https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-446031,DATASET,,"In order to estimate the potential incremental hydrocarbon recovery by gas injection, compositional reservoir simulators are commonly used in the industry. Successful design and implementation of gas injection processes (mainly CO₂) rely in part on the accuracy by which the available simulation tools can represent the physics that govern the displacement behavior in a reservoir. ❧ In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the accuracy of some physical models that are frequently used to describe and interpret dispersive mixing and mass transfer in compositional reservoir simulation. The calculations from compositional simulation are compared with the experimental observations. ❧ A quaternary analog fluid system (alcohol‐water‐hydrocarbon) that mimics the phase behavior of CO₂‐hydrocarbon mixtures at high pressure and temperature has been designed in our research group. A porous medium was designed using Teflon materials to ensure that the analog oil acts as the wetting phase, and the properties of the porous medium were characterized in terms of porosity and permeability. Relative permeability and interfacial tension measurements were also performed to delineate interactions between the fluid system and the porous medium. Displacement experiments at First‐contact miscible (FCM), near‐miscible and multicontact miscible (MCM) conditions were consequently performed (Rastegar, 2010). ❧ The effluent concentrations from two‐component FCM displacement experiments exhibit a tailing behavior that is attributed to imperfect sweep of the porous medium: A feature that is not captured by normal dispersion models. To represent this behavior in displacement calculations, we use dual‐porosity (DP) models including mass transfer between flowing and stagnant porosities. The 4‐component two‐phase displacement experiments (near‐miscible and MCM) are consequently simulated using the DP models constructed based on observations from FCM displacements. ❧ We demonstrate that the accuracy of our displacement calculations relative to the experimental observations is sensitive to the selected models for dispersive mixing, mass transfer between flowing and stagnant porosities, and IFT scaling of relative permeability functions. We also demonstrate that numerical calculations substantially agree with the experimental observations for some physical models with limited need for model parameter adjustment. ❧ The second part of this thesis is devoted to diffusion and matrix‐fracture interactions during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. Molecular diffusion can play a significant role in oil recovery during gas injection in fractured reservoirs, especially when matrix permeability is low and fracture intensity is high. Diffusion of gas components from a fracture into the matrix extracts oil components from matrix and delays, to some extent, the gas breakthrough. This in turn increases both sweep and displacement efficiencies. ❧ In current simulation models, molecular diffusion is commonly modeled using a classical Fick's law approach with constant diffusion coefficients. In the classical Fick's law approach, the dragging effects (off‐diagonal diffusion coefficients) are neglected. In addition, the gas‐oil diffusion at the fracture‐matrix interface is normally modeled by assuming an average composition at the interface which does not have a sound physical basis. ❧ In this work, we present a dual‐porosity model in which the generalized Fick's law is used for molecular diffusion to account for the dragging effects; and gas‐oil diffusion at the fracture‐matrix interface is modeled based on film theory in which the gas in fracture and oil in the matrix are assumed to be at equilibrium. A novel matrix‐fracture transfer function is introduced for gas‐oil diffusion based on film theory. Diffusion coefficients are calculated using the Maxwell‐Stefan model and are pressure, temperature and composition dependent. A time‐dependent transfer function is used for matrix‐fracture exchange in which the shape factor is adjusted using a boost factor to differentiate between the transfer rate at early and late times. ❧ Field‐scale examples are used to show that our approach, which is based on a sophisticated physical model for gas‐oil diffusion (film theory), gives significantly different results from the conventional approach. It is also demonstrated that the dragging effects (off‐diagonal diffusion coefficients) and time‐dependency of matrix‐fracture transfer function can moderately impact the oil recovery during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. We also show that miscibility is not developed in the matrix blocks even at pressures above minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) when molecular diffusion is the main recovery mechanism during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. ❧ In recent years, coalbed methane has become an important source of energy in the United States. Since primary production techniques typically recover less than half of the methane in a coalbed, enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery processes are needed in which CO₂ and/or N₂ are injected into the coalbed to recover more CH₄. ❧ One of the main mechanisms that govern the dynamics of ECBM recovery processes is the sorption of gases onto the coal surfaces. Despite the well‐documented complexity of multicomponent sorption phenomena, adsorption and desorption of CH₄/CO₂/N₂ mixtures in the porous coal is commonly modeled with the extended Langmuir model. The extended Langmuir model has been proven unable to accurately describe the multicomponent sorption that is central to ECBM recovery processes and, therefore, more sophisticated sorption models are needed. ❧ In the third part of this thesis we apply potential theory to describe the multicomponent sorption of relevance to ECBM processes. In this approach for modeling multicomponent sorption, each component is assumed to be affected by a characteristic potential field emitted by the coal surface. We discuss the implementation of potential theory with emphasis on the simulation of ECBM processes where computational efficiency and accuracy must be balanced. The model must be solved by an iterative scheme, and is hence more computationally expensive than the extended Langmuir approach. ❧ The results and analysis presented in this work demonstrate that the application of potential theory of sorption to modeling of ECBM recovery processes can improve the accuracy of calculations. However, the additional complexity of the model and the associated increase in the computational efforts may not balance the gain in accuracy sufficiently to warrant application in general purpose reservoir simulation.",10.25549/usctheses-c3-446031,Petroleum Engineering|CO₂ injection|reservoir simulation|enhanced oil recovery|molecular diffusion|fractured reservoirs|dispersion,,,,2015-01-01,usc.dl,Mass transfer during enhanced hydrocarbon recovery by gas injection processes,,

The observed behavior is in line with the predictions of a simple piecewise linear model of social preferences. Overall, individuals opportunistically draw from others' resources to offset risk; furthermore, they display higher levels of risk aversion when delegated to choose for others rather than when choosing for themselves. However, different social types differ in the assessment of interpersonal risk. Considering our results, we suggest that studies dealing with interpersonal risk assessment should not only focus on risk preferences, but also take into account social preferences.

Software unbundling consists of the division of a software into bundles (smaller and/or specialized modules) usually due to emerging features that deserves to become a product on their own, maintenance easiness, team wotk division, etc. The exploratory study supported by JUnbundler focus on API undundability based on client usage, which analyses how the API clients usage migth be take in account throught the unbundling process of those APIs.

The JUnbundler source code is available at: https://github.com/severoufc/junbundler.
",10.17632/79cnxss98s.1,Computer Science|Software,Universidade Federal do Ceara,Computer Science|Software,"To run the unbundling process, import the JUnbundler project into your workspace and execute the JUnbundler class (jubundler/src/main/java/JUnbundler.java). This dataset comes with our APIs list configured into ""jubundler/apis/apis.json"" but you are free to include and exclude to APIs you want to analyze.

This project consumes a list of API clients which are mined with the BOA language and infrastructure (check Related Links).

Basic workflow is described bellow:
* If you do not want to perform the analysis for a API of your choice, skip to step 8 *

1. Choose your target API for analysis;
2. Go to ""junbundler/apis"" folder and create a directory for your own API as follows:
---- junbundler/
-------- apis/
------------ {API_NAME}/
---------------- data/
-------------------- input/
-------------------- output/
----------------- scripts/
----------------- source/

3. Download your API source and copy it into data/source inside your API folder. Compacted files should be extracted;
4. Collect the API base package (i.e., for Google Gson API the base package is 'com.google.gson');
5. Copy the template script for API clients mining is available on ""jubundler/scripts/boa-imports-template.boa"" and change the target package name with yours;
6. Go to the BOA website (see Related Links), request a user account. Log in, go to the ""Run Examples"" page and submit the code from step 4;
6.1 Your job will be executed on the BOA infrastructure for a while. Once it is finished, download the output file (if there is any) on the ""Job List"" page;
6.2 Copy the BOA output file into your API data/input folder with the following name: imports_[API_NAME].txt (e.g., for Gson it would be imports_Gson.txt);
7. Edit the ""junbundler/apis/apis.json"" file including an entry for your API. A detailed description of each key of this file can be found in the ""Source"" folder of this dataset.
8. Run the JUnbundler class (""junbundler/src/main/java/JUnbundler.java"").

# About execution and results:

- This program execution includes large text files parsing, Trinagular Dependency Matrix construction and API source code structure analysis, thus it can take a while to complete, from several minutes up to few days, depending on your machine specifications and target APIs for analysis. Be aware that APIs which yields huge usage files may take a lot of memory to build Trinagular Dependency Matrix. It's recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM to run this program with the current API set.
- All result files will be located in the ""studies"" folder under the project root directory with the name ""unbundling-study-{EXECUTION_TIMESTAMP}"", where {EXECUTION_TIMESTAMP} correspond to the time the program finished.

Jolles, Briggs, Araya-Ajoy, & Boogert (2019) Personality, plasticity and predictability in sticklebacks: bold fish are less plastic and more predictable than shy fish.

SUMMARY:
In this study we tested 80 individual wild-caught three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) repeatedly over a 10-week period in a classic boldness assay to investigate the links between the personality, plasticity and predictability. Fish were tested in random order in one of eight replicate testing boxes under controlled laboratory conditions. Using a mixed-modelling approach we demonstrate that individual variation in boldness, i.e. the tendency to trade off risks versus potential rewards, is fundamentally linked to temporal plasticity and predictability: bold fish were less plastic in their behaviour and more predictable than shy fish. Statistical simulations using a novel statistical framework (‘SQUiD’) show that our experimental dataset has sufficient statistical power to provide accurate and precise statistical parameter estimates.

DATA:
All raw data of the boldness trials is provided in the file boldnessdat.csv and the code for running the final mixed model of the experimental dataset before the testing break and subsequently setting up and running statistical simulations using the SQuID framework cna be found in the file squidsimulations.r.

All the farms (n = 44) were visited twice in 2015. We applied a questionnaire on a common health and welfare issue in dairy cattle worldwide: lameness (abnormal locomotion). In addition, a trained veterinarian in gait scoring assessed the locomotion of all the lactating cows at the farms. The main interest we had with the present research was to know how much the farmers knew about lameness in dairy cows, what was the relative importance of lameness within the dairy herd common health issues, how aware the farmers were regarding the occurrence of this problem, and what preventative measures were used at the farms. 
We found that lameness was a common issue at the visited farms and also that farmers found lameness a secondary health problem at their farms. The farmers made estimates of lameness prevalence that were lower than the veterinarian's estimates. The farmers did not practice commonly preventative measures to avoid the occurrence of lameness. 
This information is important in order to design preventative veterinary approach in small-scale dairy farms in Brazil and may be useful to think on building population medicine strategies in small-scale dairy farms in another countries.

The original daily weather data used to calculate growing season (June through September) precipitation and evapotranspiration are obtained from Daymet (https://daymet.ornl.gov/).

This data is unique in that well yield is observed or can be inferred. Well yield is a variable that has not been observed at the well level with accuracy in other groundwater use data. Using this unique data, we sought to answer the following two main questions:

Research hypothesis 1: Ignoring (omitting) well yield leads to biased estimation of the impact of pumping costs on groundwater demand (price elasticity of demand for groundwater).

Research hypothesis 2: Well yield is a key determinant of annual groundwater use volumes for agricultural production

We found that ignoring (omitting) well yield severely over-estimates the importance of pumping costs in groundwater demand regression analysis. This indicates that water pricing may be much less effective as a tool to conserve water than previously considered. Finally, we found well yield is a much more influential determinant of groundwater use compared to pumping cost. These general results are consistent for Nebraska and Colorado.

Experiment 1 showed more errors in stress identification when f0 peaks and stressed syllables were not aligned – despite phonological association of pitch accent and stressed syllable. Erroneous responses revealed a response bias towards the syllable with the f0 peak. In a visual-world eye-tracking study (Experiment 2), listeners fixated a stress competitor with initial stress more when the spoken target, which had penultimate stress, was realized with an early-peak accent (f0 peak preceding stressed syllable), compared to a condition with the f0 peak on the stressed syllable. Hence, high-pitched unstressed syllables are temporarily interpreted as stressed – a process directly affecting lexical activation. To investigate whether this stress competitor activation is guided by the frequent co-occurrence of high f0 and lexical stress, Experiment 3 increased the frequency of low-pitched stressed syllables in the immediate input. The effect of intonation on competitor fixations disappeared. The paper discusses these findings with respect to a frequency-based mechanism and their implications for the nature of f0 processing.

We retrieved all Dutch Twitter messages (statuses or tweets) written between 07-28-17 and 12-02-17 that included the words: ‘vaccinatie’, ‘vaccineer’, ‘vaccineert’, ‘vaccineren’, ‘vaccineerde’, ‘vaccineerden’, ‘gevaccineerd’, ‘gevaccineerden’, ‘vaccin’, ‘vaccins’, ‘inenting’, or ‘inenten’ . This produced a collection of 2,869 tweets by 1,684 unique users.
Many of these tweets resulted from (multiple) interactions between users. For example, 823 of our 2,869 original tweets (28.7%) were replies, 414 (14.4%) were retweets, and 249 (8.7%) were quotes. Many of these statuses would not have been written without an original tweet to retweet, quote, or reply to. As we wanted our data to reflect this context, we retrieved the (chains of) tweets that triggered the retweets, quotes, and replies in our initial set, resulting in 2,437 extra tweets by 1,197 unique users, of whom 324 unique users were present in our initial data set. This led to a sample set of 5,306 unique messages written by 2,557 unique users.

*Nodelist and edgelist*

Just a small section of all registered Twitter users actively tweet; many users merely lurk or are inactive [21,22]. However, connections between non-tweeting and tweeting users make up a large part of the digital infrastructure that facilitates the circulation of vaccine-related content and can be used to reveal the underlying social context. Therefore, for each of the unique Twitter accounts in our earlier-retrieved set of tweets (the authors), we retrieved all their followers (accounts following the authors: 34,135,154) and followees (accounts followed by the authors: 1,288,618). 

We were interested in identifying online communities based on shared interests (who the authors are following) and shared audiences (who the authors are followed by). We therefore excluded followers and followees who were not connected to at least 15 authors. We determined this cut-off point by examining the distribution of the number of connections with authors and arrived at our ultimate network size to stay within the limits of what our hardware and software were capable of handling in terms of visualization. Ultimately, our network included 121,623 Twitter accounts and 3,706,124 connections. We used the Louvain algorithm to detect communities in our network. This is known as a fast, but relatively accurate, method to detect communities in large-scale networks.

In this study, we created a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HdAd) to co-express cytoplasmic EGFP and a genetically encoded peroxidase marker (mito-APEX2) at the calyx of Held, an excellent model for deciphering regulatory mechanisms of presynaptic function.

ABSTRACT:
The calyx of Held, a large glutamatergic presynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem undergoes developmental changes to support the high action-potential firing rates required for auditory information encoding. In addition, calyx terminals are morphologically diverse which impacts vesicle release properties and synaptic plasticity. Mitochondria influence synaptic plasticity through calcium buffering and are crucial for providing the energy required for synaptic transmission. Therefore, it has been postulated that mitochondrial levels increase during development and contribute to the morphological-functional diversity in the mature calyx. However, the developmental profile of mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distribution at the calyx of Held remains unclear. To provide insight on this, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HdAd) that expresses the genetically encoded peroxidase marker for mitochondria, mito-APEX2, at the mouse calyx of Held. We developed protocols to detect labeled mitochondria for use with serial block face scanning electron microscopy to carry out semi-automated segmentation of mitochondria, high-throughput whole terminal reconstruction and presynaptic ultrastructure in mice of either sex. Subsequently, we measured mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distributions at the immature postnatal day 7 (P7) and the mature (P21) calyx. We found an increase of mitochondria volumes in terminals and axons from P7 to P21 but did not observe differences between stalk and swelling subcompartments in the mature calyx. Based on these findings, we propose that mitochondrial volumes and synaptic localization developmentally increase to support high firing rates required in the initial stages of auditory information processing.
