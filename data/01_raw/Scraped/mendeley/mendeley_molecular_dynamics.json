Zebrafish offer a unique opportunity to explore this issue, not only because a great deal is known about key developmental events in this species, but also because the clock starts on the very first day of development. In this study, we identified numerous rhythmic genes in zebrafish larvae, including the key transcriptional regulators neurod and cdx1b, which are involved in neuronal and intestinal differentiation, respectively. Rhythmic expression of neurod and several additional transcription factors was only observed in the developing retina. Surprisingly, these rhythms in expression commenced at a stage of development after these transcription factors are known to have played their essential role in photoreceptor differentiation. Furthermore, this circadian regulation was maintained in adult retina. Thus, once mature photoreceptors are formed, multiple retinal transcription factors fall under circadian clock control, at which point they appear to play a new and important role in regulating rhythmic elements in the phototransduction pathway.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.r07bc", "publicationDate": "2014-06-13", "dateAvailable": "2014-06-13", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r07bc", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Energetic materials are a class of materials with high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released. Propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnic are typical classes of energetic materials. In the past decade, energetic materials have been playing very important roles in the fields of defense and other technologies, since they are secure, convenient and energetically compact, which will be continuously functionalized for further improvements indispensably in the new era. The significance of how to utilize the novel and promising features more profitably and constructively will necessitate fundamental understanding of dynamics of the material releasing energy through reactions. \u2767 Among all kinds of energetic materials, aluminum nanostructures and high explosives are the subjects studied in this dissertation. For aluminum nanostructures, we have performed multimillion atom reactive MD simulations to investigate the oxidation dynamics of aluminum nanoparticles (Al-NPs), Al-NP aggregates, and aluminum nanorods (Al-NRs). For high explosives, we have addressed the shock\u2010induced detonation of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX, an initialism for Research Department Explosive). \u2767 The scientific interest in aluminum nanostructures research basically lies in the increased reactivity during oxidation as compared with conventional micro\u2010sized structures. However, what is the size effect on the reactivities of the Al-NPs still puzzles researchers. Practically, Al-NPs commercially produced always have a thin oxide layer encapsulating the pure metal particles. The oxide shell has been included in all our simulated aluminum nanostructures to accurately represent the reality as much as possible. We have systematically simulated different sizes of single Al-NPs (diameter, D = 26, 36 and 46 nm) to study their reactivities in oxygen environments as isolated individuals. We have also systematically extended our study to their assemblies\u2014Al-NP aggregates with different sizes in oxygen environments. Aluminum nanorods (Al-NRs), a different type of morphology, also have been investigated due to their high contact areas with oxidizers. Our MD simulations reveal, within the range of our studied cases, the smaller sizes of aluminum nanostructures have higher reactivities (e.g., faster reaction rate, shorter reaction time and faster oxidation speed). Meanwhile, our atomistic analyses show interesting and unexpected roles of the interfaces of the oxide shell with aluminum and oxygen environment during the initial oxidation. In addition, the processes of final product formation show the evolution of different major intermediate species. Such atomistic understanding of the interface, reaction pathways and the size effect should have profound impacts on the design of the efficient burning of intermolecular products. \u2767 The second topic of this dissertation is the detonation of a high explosive, RDX. Despite many years of intense research, atomistic mechanisms underlying the reaction time and intermediate reaction products of detonating high explosives have been elusive. Our reactive MD simulations reveal a novel two\u2010stage reaction mechanism during the detonation of RDX crystal. Rapid production of N\u2082 and H\u2082O is followed by delayed production of CO molecules. We have found that further decomposition towards the final products is inhibited by the formation of large, metastable carbon\u2010 and oxygen\u2010rich clusters. Such atomistic understanding may pave a way toward rational design for detonation synthesis of materials.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-458055", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-458055", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

We provide experimental and computational evidence that conformational flexibility can assist the emergence and subsequent evolution of new active sites by improving substrate and transition-state binding, through the sampling of many potentially productive conformations. Our results suggest a mechanism for the emergence of primordial enzymes and highlight the potential of ancestral reconstruction as a tool for protein engineering.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.53629", "publicationDate": "2017-07-20", "dateAvailable": "2017-07-20", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.53629", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Due to the emergence of bird flu disease and the drug resistant strain of H5N1, the M2 channel has become an important target for anti-flu drug development. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the proton-selective transmembrane M2 channel in fully hydrated phospholipid bilayer were carried out to investigate structural and dynamic properties underlying the proton transport mechanism. Molecular mechanism of protein function relies on the histidine residues of the tetrameric channel, acting like the gate for transport of a proton through membrane bilayer. For this study, all possible protonation states of the ionizable His37 were constructed to have neutral and positively charged imidazole up to +4. The six studied models correspond to non-, mono-, di- (at adjacent and diagonal subunit), tri- and tetraprotonation states. The results show that except for non- and di -protonation states at adjadcent position, the transport of water molecule across the channel was observed. In addition, the binding of amantadine and rimantadine, the channel blocker, were also assessed by MD simulation approach. MD results suggested two potential binding sites for the drugs, i.e, the residues near the extracellular mouth and inside the inner cavity of the channel pore. Moreover, rimantadine showed the blocking activity of the water transport more efficient than amantadine. This biological activity of the drugs agrees well with experimental data. For the last topic of the thesis, MD simulations of the drug resistant M2 mutants were performed. Three single mutants including S31N, A30T, and L26I were studied to gain insight into molecular mechanisms of drug binding and resistance. The results indicated that in tri-protonation state amantadine loses its function in the A30T mutant while the degree of resistance to amantadine in the L26I mutant is higher than that in the S31N mutant.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2007.2029", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2007.2029", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to understand this extra-ordinary behavior of \u03b1-resorcinol in terms of dissolution and growth on (0\u035e1\u035e1) and (011) faces. Four investigations were carried out: (i) dissolution of \u03b1-resorcinol in water at a number of temperatures; (ii) crystal growth from solutions at three supersaturation levels; (iii) crystal growth from vapour and (iv) crystal growth from melt at various temperatures. The results showed that dissolution and crystal growth rates were faster on the (0\u035e1\u035e1) face, the polar face, which is consistent with experimental observations. The dissolution and crystal growth were more marked at higher temperatures where the molecules have higher energy and able to diffuse much more rapidly. However, too high a temperature caused surface reconstruction in the simulation of crystal growth from vapour. The supersaturation levels influenced the crystal growth in solution. The higher supersaturation level caused faster growth rate as expected, in particular on the (0\u035e1\u035e1) face. The simulations clearly reveal the distinct molecular behavior of the molecules that gives rise to the asymmetry in crystal growth and dissolution. However, it is not apparent as to what exactly is the origin of the behavior.

In previous studies it was found that K\u207a ions were allowed entrance into the channels' selectivity filter while Na\u207a ions were excluded from the selectivity filter at threonine 75. To determine ion selectivity in the bacterial K\u207a-selective channel KcsA, mutational analysis was conducted on threonine 75 using molecular dynamics simulations. A step-wise pulling protocol was used to pull both K\u207a and Na\u207a ions through the wild type and mutant channels in order to estimate any changes of conductance or selectivity by the use of force profiles. Mutations were chosen specifically to investigate the importance of each of the side groups of threonine to selectivity. The three mutations studied changed threonine 75 to serine, valine or cysteine. In comparison to the wild type, both the valine and serine mutants excluded K\u207a and Na\u207a from entering into the selectivity filter while the cysteine mutant allowed both the K\u207a and Na\u207a ion to enter the selectivity filter. Interpretation of this data indicated that valine and serine mutants both decrease the conductance as well as the selectivity ratio of the KcsA channel. However, the cysteine mutant, which lost both methyl and hydroxyl groups, allows entry of both K\u207a and Na\u207a ions into the selectivity filter and may cause an increase in conductance as well as a decrease in the selectivity ratio. Results from molecular dynamics simulations help investigators to look at particle movement on a short temporal scale as well as helps make future experimental design more efficient. In future work, mutations will be inserted into KcsA DNA using PCR and conductance measurements will be taken using the patch clamp technique.

The enzymatic activity of ACs is carefully controlled by a variety of molecules, including G-protein subunits that can both stimulate and inhibit cAMP production. Using homology models developed from existing structural data, we have carried out all-atom, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations on the AC5 isoform of adenylyl cyclase and on its complexes with ATP and with the stimulatory G-protein subunit Gs\u03b1. The results show that both ATP and Gs\u03b1 binding have significant effects on the structure and flexibility of adenylyl cyclase. New data on ATP bound to AC5 in the absence of Gs\u03b1 notably help to explain how Gs\u03b1 binding enhances enzyme activity and could aid product release.

The properties of the aggregates in turn are dictated by the molecular architecture of the amphiphiles. A complete understanding of the multiscale architecture\u2013structure\u2013function relationship for amphiphile-based aggregates requires the simultaneous resolution of the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules along with an understanding of the role of various long range physical interactions including hydrodynamics. A multiscale computational approach such as the hybrid Molecular Dynamics\u2013Lattice Boltzmann technique is able to fulfill most of those requirements. However, existing implementations only account for static coupling between the Molecular Dynamics technique and the Lattice Boltzmann method, and hence are unable to resolve the changes in the solvent-amphiphile interface during processes such as self-assembly and interfacial adsorption. In this study, a new implementation incorporating a dynamic coupling scheme between the Molecular Dynamics technique and the Lattice Boltzmann method is introduced so as to resolve dynamical changes in interfaces. The application of the new implementation to the self-assembly of phospholipids yields results which are in good agreement with computation, experiments and theory.

Molecular dynamics simulations provide mechanistic information that often cannot be detected by experiment alone and also serve as a predictive tool to stimulate new research. However, sophisticated modeling of ultrafast processes, especially those involving excited states, is intellectually challenging and computationally demanding. The work presented here provides several diverse examples of challenging gas phase and condensed phase ultrafast photoinduced processes. For each system, we offer a detailed account of the computational modeling scheme employed for an accurate description of the chemical and physical properties of interest. At the same time, we highlight the limitations of the particular dynamics methods used. \u2767 In Chapter 1, we start with an overview of the adiabatic and the non-adiabatic dynamics. This is followed by a description of the primary non-adiabatic dynamics methods, the Ehrenfest dynamics and the Fewest Switches Surface Hopping method. We also describe the major limitations of the two approaches, especially the neglect of decoherence effects among others. \u2767 This is followed by an example of the application of adiabatic molecular dynamics in Chapter 2 to study the atomistic origin of room temperature coherence between the light-hole and heavy-hole excitations in two-dimensional CdSe and CdSe/CdZnS core/shell nanoplatelets, synthesized and studied recently by optical spectroscopy. The molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to mimic closely the experimental systems and measurements, and to elucidate the role of defects that are inevitably present in experiment. Chapter 3 provides another application of quantum-classical molecular dynamics to study the conversion of He(2\u00b3S) to He\u2082(a\u2083\u03a3\u1d64\u207a) in large helium nanodroplets. He \u20f0\u2082 is a likely participant in the production of He\u2084\u207a on surfaces of large helium droplets which shows an anomalously intense peak in mass spectra of large helium droplets. Ab initio molecular dynamics with highly accurate and robust equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theory, showed rapid and efficient conversion of He \u20f0  to He \u20f0\u2082 in systems composed of small numbers of Helium atoms. \u2767 The Born-Oppenheimer dynamics is followed by the non-adiabatic dynamics with electronic transitions in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 analyzes the fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm and brings attention to one of its limitations, the trivial crossing problem. It provides a comparison of the standard fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm with the Min-Cost adiabatic state identity tracking algorithm, which treats the trivial crossing problem of FSSH. The performance of the two methods is investigated for the internal conversion and energy transfer dynamics of a weakly coupled spiro-linked polyfluorene (spirobifluorene) system. The results reveal that FSSH fails to identify trivial crossings, therefore, the system remains on the upper adiabatic surface at such crossings and reaches the lowest excited state only via non-adiabatic transitions resulting in a longer relaxation time-scale as compared to the Min-Cost method. \u2767 Chapter 5 addresses the other primary mixed quantum classical dynamics method, the Ehrenfest method. Ehrenfest method does not produce the Boltzmann equilibrium populations of the quantum states at a finite temperature. Additionally, both the Ehrenfest MD and the FSSH techniques are fully quantum coherent, they do not account for decoherence. In this chapter, we present a semiclassical approach for non-adiabatic molecular dynamics based on the Ehrenfest method with corrections for decoherence effects and detailed balance. The decoherence effects are described via a coherence penalty functional that drives dynamics away from regions in Hilbert space characterized by large values of coherences. Detailed balance is described by modification of the off-diagonal matrix elements with a quantum correction factor used in semiclassical approximations to quantum time-correlation functions. Both decoherence and detailed balance corrections introduce non-linear terms to the Schrodinger equation. At the same time, the simplicity of the Ehrenfest method, which involves fully deterministic dynamics and requires a single trajectory for each initial condition, is preserved. In contrast, surface hopping techniques contain stochastic elements and require averaging over multiple realizations of stochastic process for each initial condition. The method is applied to a hybrid nanoscale system consisting of a fluorophore molecule and an STM tip studied experimentally. By investigating current-induced charge injection, cooling, and recombination, we demonstrate that the Ehrenfest-decoherence-detailed-balance (Ehrenfest-DDB) method produces timescales that are similar to those obtained with the decoherence induced surface hopping (DISH), which is a popular nonadiabatic molecular dynamics technique used with many condensed matter and nanoscale systems. The Ehrenfest-DDB technique provides efficient means to study quantum dynamics in large, realistic systems. \u2767 Finally, in chapter 6, we outline future directions and discuss further investigations of the developed computational scheme to establish the range of problems it can be applied to with useful accuracy.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-121057", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-121057", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

In particular atomistic molecular dynamics provide an opportunity to model systems that are unobservable through conventional experimental methods as well as supplement understanding of observations. In this thesis molecular dynamics were applied to study biological cell membranes, specifically lipid bilayers, the primary constituent of the cell membrane, in electric fields, and to understand the mechanism and events associated with electroporation. Electroporation is a widely used experimental and commercial technique for introducing normally excluded compounds such as DNA, RNA, ions, drugs, and other chemicals into cells. Traditional electroporation utilizes kilovolt-per-meter electric fields applied on the order of microseconds that disrupt and scramble the cell membrane and allow diffusive entry, however, ultra-short nanosecond pulses at megavolt-per-meter fields produce different effects in cells which remain largely uncharacterized. One such effect, the migration of the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine from the inner to outer leaflet of the cell, is of particular biological interest because of its association with cell apoptosis, or programmable cell death. Control of such an event could be useful in developing a targeted treatment for removing unwanted cells such as tumors or melanoma. In this thesis I begin by introducing electroporation and its history and explain how molecular dynamics and its techniques can help advance our understanding of the field.

Precise helioseismic and neutrino data provide an incredibly accurate description of the Sun. The established MHD and OPAL equations of state do not match the solar data to the available precision. A rigorous quantum-statistical formalism for Coulomb systems is used to develop new tools for equation of state modeling. Although the formalism is in principle a low-density development, the relevant parameters allow the formalism to be applied in the solar center. Solar models can also be improved through the study of nuclear reaction rates. The Coulomb potentials in the ionized plasma are screened, effectively truncating the interactions. This screening makes it easier for ions to tunnel through the potential barrier. In a seminal paper, Salpeter (1954) discussed this enhancement. He based his study on the approximation of a static screening potential. There is a legitimate concern that dynamic effects could alter the result. Since 1996, Shaviv and Shaviv have been examining this question by numerical molecular-dynamics simulations. The calculation is essentially classical, although electrons are treated with effective potentials to mimic some quantum corrections. Shaviv and Shaviv have reported dynamical effects for the fast protons which are the ions that are most likely to engage in nuclear reactions. Given the importance of these effects for solar and stellar modeling, molecular-dynamics simulations have been developed to verify the results of Shaviv and Shaviv in an independent calculation.

From simple studies of liquid argon in the 1960s to fully atomistic simulations of entire viruses in the past few years, recent advances in high-performance computing have continuously enabled simulations to bridge the gap between scientific theory and experiment. Molecular dynamics simulations in particular have allowed for the direct observation of spatial and temporal events which are at present inaccessible to experiments. For this dissertation I employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the transient, electric field-induced poration (or electroporation) of phospholipid bilayers at MV/m electric fields. \u2767 Phospholipid bilayers are the dominant constituents of cell membranes and act as both a barrier and gatekeeper to the cell interior. This makes their structural integrity and susceptibility to external perturbations an important topic for study, especially as the density of electromagnetic radiation in our environment is increasing steadily. The primary goal of this dissertation is to understand the specific physical and biological mechanisms which facilitate electroporation, and to connect our simulated observations to experiments with live cells and to continuum models which seek to describe the underlying biological processes of electroporation. \u2767 In Chapter 1 I begin with a brief introduction to phospholipids and phospholipid bilayers, followed by an extensive overview of electroporation and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The following chapters will then focus on peer-reviewed and published work we performed, or on existing projects which are currently being prepared for submission. Chapter 2 looks at how external electric fields affect both oxidized and unoxidized lipid bilayers as a function of oxidation concentration and oxidized lipid type. Oxidative damage to cell membranes represents a physiologically relevant system where lipids can become damaged or severely impacted from interacting with reactive oxygen species, and these events become more frequent with age. The results are then compared to experiments where we show agreement between our simulations, theoretical models, and experiments with peroxidized cells in our lab. In Chapter 3 I outline a set of unique metrics which can be used to quantitatively measure the life cycle of a discrete electropore for the first time, across multiple lipid species, and I compare these results to analytical models where we find good agreement with theory. In Chapter 4 I use the life cycle of an electropore as a tool to measure the effects of electrolyte and lipid headgroup charge on electroporation compared to electrolyte-free and zwitterionic systems, in addition to presenting ion binding isotherms to determine the validity of our simulated electrolyte models. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on the roles of water and lipid respectively on electroporation using simplified water:vacuum systems, osmotic swelling simulations, systems at varying temperature, and systems where we successfully modulated the electropore radius using customized time-dependent electric fields. I conclude this dissertation with a brief summary of these studies followed by a short outlook on the future of electroporation simulations as a whole.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-280283", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-280283", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

However, the analysis of trajectories for relevant but rare events, such as a jump of the diffusing mobile ion, is still rather cumbersome, requiring prior knowledge of the diffusive process in order to get meaningful results. In this work we present a novel approach to detect the relevant events in a diffusive system without assuming prior information regarding the underlying process. We start from a projection of the atomic coordinates into a landmark basis to identify the dominant features in a mobile ion's environment. Subsequent clustering in landmark space enables a discretization of any trajectory into a sequence of distinct states. As a final step, the use of the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptor allows distinguishing between different environments in a straightforward way. We apply this algorithm to ten Li-ionic systems and conduct in-depth analyses of cubic Li7La3Zr2O12, tetragonal Li10GeP2S12, and the \u03b2-eucryptite LiAlSiO4.

Determining the intrinsic mechanical properties of the individual transmembrane helices is therefore central to understanding the intricacies of the gating mechanism of MS channels. We used a constant-force steered molecular dynamics (SMD) approach to perform unidirectional pulling tests on all the helices of MscL in M. tuberculosis and E. coli homologs. Using this method, we could overcome the issues encountered with the commonly used constant-velocity SMD simulations, such as low mechanical stability of the helix during stretching and high dependency of the elastic properties on the pulling rate. We estimated Young's moduli of the \u03b1-helices of MscL to vary between 0.2 and 12.5 GPa with TM2 helix being the stiffest. We also studied the effect of water on the properties of the pore-lining TM1 helix. In the absence of water, this helix exhibited a much stiffer response. By monitoring the number of hydrogen bonds, it appears that water acts like a \u2018lubricant\u2019 (softener) during TM1 helix elongation.

The main code is based on the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm in various variants, including the powerful multilayer-MCTDH algorithm that has been used to propagate a wavefunction for up to 1000 degrees of freedom. MCTDH uses a contraction of traditional discrete basis set representations of the Hamiltonian and wavefunction, and Quantics includes a range of variable representation (DVR) grid basis sets and collocation methods. Input is via ascii text files and for molecules with analytical potential functions no programming is required. A library of potential functions is included to treat more complicated cases, and more functions can be added as required by the user. The code also includes the variational multi-configurational Gaussian (vMCG) method that is based on a Gaussian wavepacket expansion of the wavefunction. vMCG can be run in a \u201cdirect\u201d manner (DD-vMCG), calculating the potential energy surfaces on-the-fly using a number of quantum chemistry programs. In addition to wavepacket propagation, Quantics can solve the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for small systems and can solve the Liouville\u2013von-Neumann equation to propagate density matrices.

Computer simulation is used to investigate the aggregation problem. An intermediate\u2010resolution coarse\u2010grained model of proteins as well as a high\u2010resolution all\u2010atom model of proteins are employed together with discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD). This combination is approved to be fast and accurate to simulate the aggregation process of multiple\u2010protein systems. \u2767 We first investigate the aggregation of multiple polyalanine peptides in unbounded media. Different numbers of identical polyalanine peptides are simulated to mimic \u03b2\u2010amyloid aggregation in bulk solutions. In all cases we observe fibril\u2010like aggregates, which have been implicated in many neuro\u2010degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion. Various properties of the aggregates have been computed, including dynamic evolution of the total number of aggregates, mean aggregate size, number of the peptides that contribute to the formation of \u03b2\u2010sheets, number of various types of hydrogen bonds formed in the systems, radius of gyration of the aggregates, and diffusivity of the aggregates. These results show that the aggregation process follows a nucleation scenario, which is also observed in experiments. Many of the quantities follow dynamic scaling, similar to those found in the aggregation of colloidal clusters. In particular, at long times the mean aggregate size S(t) grows with time as S(t)\u223ct\u1dbb, where z is the dynamic exponent. The existence of such dynamic scaling was recently confirmed by experiments. \u2767 Next, we investigate the aggregation of the same polyalanine peptides but in confined environments. The medium, as a model of a crowded cellular environment, is represented by a spherical cavity, as well as cylindrical tubes with two aspect ratios. The aggregation process leads to the formation of \u03b2\u2010sheets and eventually fibrils. Several important properties of the aggregation process, including dynamic evolution of the total number of aggregates, mean aggregate size, and number of peptides that contribute to the formation of \u03b2\u2010sheets, have been computed. We show, similar to the unconfined media, that the computed properties follow dynamic scaling, characterized by power laws. The exponents that characterize the power\u2010law in spherical cavities are shown to agree with those in unbounded media in the same protein density, while the exponents for the aggregation in cylindrical tubes exhibit sensitivity to the geometry of the system. The effects on aggregation from the protein size, i.e. the number of amino acids in a protein, as well as the size of the confined media, have also been studied. Similarities and differences between the aggregations in confined and unconfined media are described. \u2767 Last, we use DMD combined with an all\u2010atom model of proteins to investigate the aggregation of poly\u2010glycine\u2010alanine in unbounded media. The simulation shows poly\u2010glycine\u2010alanine is an aggregation\u2010prone protein and will eventually form \u03b2\u2010sheet\u2010rich aggregates, which matches the experiment observations. Dynamic evolution of the total number of aggregates has been calculated. In the simulations, we observe two unique helical structures, \u03b2\u2010helix and double\u2010helix, frequently form in different configurations. We investigate their structures in detail and the analysis results show that such helical structures are very stable and share the characteristics of both \u03b1\u2010helix and \u03b2\u2010sheet. Identical phenomena are also observed in poly\u2010glycine\u2010arginine systems. We propose that proteins having the sequence of (GX)\u2099, where X could be any non\u2010glycine amino acid and n is the repeat length, would share the same folding structures of \u03b2\u2010helix and double\u2010helix, and it is the glycine in the repeat that contributes to this characteristic.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-76032", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-76032", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

However, the service life of these materials is often limited due to the formation of cracks and defects that leads to their eventual failure, thus insights into atomistic mechanisms underlying these processes are valuable inputs for the design of next-generation nanostructured materials. In this research work, large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, combined with machine learning and data mining techniques is used to understand three basic problems related to nanostructured materials design with superior mechanical properties, which are: (1) ultra-light material design using hierarchical structures like kagom\u00e9 lattices, (2) self-healing of cracks in alumina composite embedded with SiC/SiO\u2082 nanoparticles, and (3) toughing of MoWSe\u2082 monolayer during crack propagation by novel strain-induced structural phase transformation. \u2767 Many natural and man-made materials exhibit hierarchical structures like for example bird wings, Eiffel tower, Garabit Viaduct. This hierarchy in structures can be used for materials design at the atomic level as it allows us to tune several materials properties like stiffness, compressive strength, fracture toughness by just changing the underlying structural arrangement of materials. In the first work, we have studied the deformation behavior of an ultralight architecture consisting of hollow Ni nanotubes and solid nanorods arranged as a 3-D kagom\u00e9 structure. Our result shows that hollow kagom\u00e9 structure have higher strength and stiffness in comparison of solid kagom\u00e9 structures. The hollow kagom\u00e9 structure shows two stage deformation mechanism where up to 11% strain, deformation is highly localized near the nodal region and at higher strain they show bending-dominated deformation. Whereas in solid kagom\u00e9 structures, large defamations are observed in the entire structure even at lower strain. \u2767 Designing material systems that can sense and repair damage is of great interest. Inspired by biological systems, material scientists are developing self-healing materials in which damage initiation triggers an automatic release and transport of healing agent to the damage site and repairs it. In the second work, we have investigated crack healing in a ceramic nanocomposite of alumina containing SiC/SiO\u2082 nanoparticles. Our result shows that the nanoparticles closest to the advancing crack in alumina distort to create nanochannels through which silica flows toward the crack and heals the damage. Under applied strain, alumina matrix also forms facets at interfaces. These facets act as nucleation sites for multiple secondary amorphous grains in alumina matrix. Nanovoids form along the grain boundaries but these nanovoids are again healed by molten silica released from the nanoparticles. The mechanisms of crack healing in alumina will help experimentalists to design novel self-healing ceramics for a broad class of energy technologies. \u2767 Two-dimensional materials exhibit different mechanical property in comparison of their bulk counterpart owing to their monolayer atomic thickness. In fact, properties of these layered materials can be tuned by mechanical deformation. In the third work, we have examined the atomistic mechanisms of defect formation and crack propagation in a strained monolayer MoWSe\u2082 alloy using molecular dynamics. Our result shows that under strain, the crack meanders as it propagates through the system and branches into daughter cracks when it crosses the MoSe\u2082/WSe\u2082 interface and enters the WSe\u2082 patches. The most dramatic change occurs in the process zone around the crack tip, where large stress concentration and the resulting biaxial tensile strain trigger an irreversible local structural phase transformation from the ground state 2H crystal structure to the 1T crystal structure. This phenomenon of crack branching, crack closure and strain induced phase transformation in MoWSe\u2082 alloy increases its fracture toughness.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-80832", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-80832", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Reference values are obtained using a hierarchy of Dunning's (d-)aug-cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, Q, 5) basis sets. The results are discussed together with the available CCSD values in terms of basis set and correlation method errors, and their ratio. Detailed analysis shows that already the def2-SVPD basis set can be used in CCS polarisability calculations. When affordable, the slightly larger aug-pc-1 basis set is recommended, as it leads to significant reduction of basis set error. The def2-TZVPD, LPol-ds, and aug-pc-2 basis sets are optimal choice within the CC2 approximation, with the latter allowing to approach the CC2 basis set limit. The LPol-ds, -dl, and def2-TZVPD sets outperform the aug-cc-pVTZ set in average polarisability CCSD calculations, with the def2-TZVPD being competitive to other reduced-size sets also in determination of polarisability anisotropy. The aug-pc-2 basis is a particularly attractive choice for CCSD, giving the accuracy of aug-cc-pVQZ at a significantly reduced computational cost. The polarisability anisotropy is shown to be more computationally demanding than the average polarisability, in particular with respect to the accuracy of the correlation method and an accurate evaluation of this property requires at least the CCSD model.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.1378883.v3", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.1378883.v3", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

As researchers around the world are trying to expand the current understanding of the behavior of materials at the atomistic scale, the limited resolution of equipment, both in terms of time and space, act as roadblocks to a comprehensive study. Numerical methods, in general and molecular dynamics, in particular act as able compliment to the experiments in our quest for understanding material behavior. In this research work, large scale molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the mechano-chemical behavior under extreme conditions of a variety of systems with many real world applications. The body of this work is divided into three parts, each covering a particular system: \u2767 1) Aggregates of aluminum nanoparticles are good solid fuel due to high flame propagation rates. Multi-million atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism underlying higher reaction rate in a chain of aluminum nanoparticles as compared to an isolated nanoparticle. This is due to the penetration of hot atoms from reacting nanoparticles to an adjacent, unreacted nanoparticle, which brings in external heat and initiates exothermic oxidation reactions. \u2767 2) Cavitation bubbles readily occur in fluids subjected to rapid changes in pressure. We use billion-atom reactive molecular dynamics simulations on a 163,840-processor BlueGene/P supercomputer to investigate chemical and mechanical damages caused by shock-induced collapse of nanobubbles in water near amorphous silica. Collapse of an empty nanobubble generates high-speed nanojet, resulting in the formation of a pit on the surface. The pit contains a large number of silanol groups and its volume is found to be directly proportional to the volume of the nanobubble. The gas-filled bubbles undergo partial collapse and consequently the damage on the silica surface is mitigated. \u2767 3) The structure and dynamics of water confined in nanoporous silica are different from that of bulk water, and insight into the properties of confined water is important for our understanding of many geological and biological processes. Nanoporous silica has a wide range of technological applications because it is easy to tune the size of pores and their morphologies and to functionalize pore surfaces with a variety of molecular moieties. Nanoporous silica is used in catalysis, chromatography, anticorrosion coatings, desalination membranes, and as drug delivery vehicles. We use reactive molecular dynamics to study the structure and dynamics of nanoconfined water between 100 and 300 K.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-321802", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-321802", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

There are several drug targets which are reported to control the severe level of AD; notably, acetylcholinesterase, \u03b2-Secretase and glycogen synthase kinase enzymes are approached as a good drug targets for AD. Hence, the present study mainly focused to discover newly synthesized molecule (7-propyl-6H-pyrano[3,2-c:5,6-c']dichromene-6,8(7H)-dione) as a potential triplet acting drug for above said enzymes through the analysis of X-ray crystallography, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculation. The target drug molecule was crystallized in the monoclinic crystal structure with P21/n space group. The structure was solved by SHELXS and refined by SHELXL. The crystal packing is stabilized by C\u2009\u2212\u2009H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O type of interactions. Further, the induced fit docking shows that the molecule has high docking score, glide energy, favorable hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions on the protein targets. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed to understand the stability of the molecule in the presence of active site environment. Finally, quantum chemical calculation has been carried out for the molecule in gas phase and for the corresponding molecule lifted from the active site region. The structural comparison between gas phase and active site helps to understand the conformational modification of the molecule in the active site. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Hence, the present study mainly focused to discover newly synthesized molecule (7-propyl-6H-pyrano[3,2-c:5,6-c']dichromene-6,8(7H)-dione) as a potential triplet acting drug for above said enzymes through the analysis of X-ray crystallography, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculation.

The molecular dynamics simulation was performed to understand the stability of the molecule in the presence of active site environment. Finally, quantum chemical calculation has been carried out for the molecule in gas phase and for the corresponding molecule lifted from the active site region.

The key significance for the S4 motion is to drive the gate located in the pore domain of the channels opening or closing in respond to changes in the membrane potential. The molecular mechanism of voltage-dependent conformational transition of VSD is not clearly understood. Unfortunately, crystal structures of a number of voltage-gated ion channels including Kv1.2, KvAP, NavAb and NavRh, could represent the voltage sensor in an only one state so-called \u201cUp\u201d or activated conformation. In this thesis, a computational study of the activated (Up) and resting (Down) conformations of the isolated VSD from the prokaryotic K+ channel KvAP is presented. The Down sensor model was developed based on the PaDSAR approach, molecular dynamics simulations and solvent continuum gating charge calculations. The results show that KvAP-VSD transforms from the resting to activated conformations by an upward tilt and slide of the S4 helix to the upper face of membrane bilayer with a distance of 3-5\u00c5. This motion was associated with the movement of gating charge arginines and a change in salt-bridge arginines, giving rise to an increase of water penetration into the voltage sensor core. The reorientation of helical dipoles on S4 and a change in the internal dielectric constant of VSD should involve with the voltage-sensing mechanism. Comparison of the simulations with and without external electric fields revealed that the presence of membrane potential helps to stabilize the Down conformation of KvAP-VSD. The gating charge for the models was calculated to be 2.82\u00b10.09e per monomer. This is in good agreement with the experimental estimates of 12\u201314e measured for the Shaker K+ tetrameric channel.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2012.295", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2012.295", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

Despite its biological abundance and importance, little is known about the transport mechanism of Mg2+ CorA is the primary Mg2+ transport protein in prokaryotic organisms. The crystal structures of CorA from Thermogota Maritima were determined in the presence of Mg2+, corresponding to a closed state. However, the open state conformation has remained uncharacterized, thus limiting our understanding of the functional mechanism of Mg2+ transport in biological system. In this study, an open conformation has been constructed using electron paramagnetic resonance data and PaDSAR approach. Subsequently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the closed and open conformations in lipid bilayer have been performed to understand the relation between structure and function of the protein. A structure model of the open conformation showed the stalk helices being closer to the symmetry axis while the TM1 helices move further away from the principal axis. Such structural arrangement has led to an increase of the pore cavity in the membrane region. From the MD results, all structural domains of the open conformation are more dynamics than those of the closed state. Within the protein, the cytoplasmic domain and the periplasmic loop are highly flexible with respect to the stalk and transmembrane helices. An analysis of Mg2+ coordination of all binding sites in the simulations of the closed conformation revealed hexa-coordinated Mg2+ with ligands mostly from either aspartate residues and/or water. The force profiles obtained from a steered molecular dynamics method showed a high driving force for the movement of Mg2+ at the periplasmic entrance of the pore in both closed and open states, suggesting a possible role of the periplasmic loop for the ion-selective property.

By combining the lowering serum triglyceride levels benefit of PPAR\u03b1 agonists (such as fibrates) with the glycemic advantages of the PPAR\u03b3 agonists (such as TZD), the dual PPAR agonists approach can both improve the metabolic effects and minimize the side effects caused by either agent alone, and hence, has become a promising strategy for designing effective drugs against type-2 diabetes. In this study, by means of virtual screening, ADMET prediction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations techniques, one compound-ASN15761007 with high binding score, low toxicity were gained. It was observed by MD simulations that ASN15761007 not only possessed the same function as AZ242 did in activating PPAR\u03b1 and BRL did in activating PPAR\u03b3, but also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors.

Approximately two million deaths result annually from bacterial infections worldwide. Therefore, there is a paramount requirement to develop innovative and novel antibacterial agents with new mechanisms of action and activity against resistant bacterial strains. For this purpose, a set of benzothiazole and N-phenylpyrrolamides derivatives reported as DNA Gyrase B (GyrB) inhibitors were collected from the literature and docked inside the receptor cavity of DNA Gyrase B (PDB ID: 5L3J). The best 10 docked complexes were used to identify novel antibacterial chemical agents through a de novo design approach. Out of initial 300 chemical analogues, the best six analogues were identified using screening with a set of criteria followed by pharmacokinetic analysis. The binding interactions of the best six analogues revealed that all molecules formed a number of critical interactions with catalytic amino residues of DNA Gyrase B with high binding energy. The predicted inhibitory constant biological activity based on binding energy supported the potential of the molecules as DNA Gyrase B ligands. The RMSD, RMSF, and radius of gyration parameters obtained from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation study clearly demonstrated that all six analogues were efficient enough to form stable complexes with DNA Gyrase B. High negative binding energy of all ligands obtained from MM-GBSA approach undoubtedly explained the strong affinity toward the DNA Gyrase B. Therefore, the proposed de novo designed molecules can be considered as promising antibacterial chemical agents subject to experimental validation, in vitro. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

ZIF-78 is a promising material for the separation of CO\u2082 from a gas mixture. In this work, the molecular behavior of CO\u2082 and CH\u2084 in ZIF-78 as well as the adsorption selectivity and diffusion selectivity of CO\u2082 in CO\u2082/CH\u2084 mixtures were investigated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The RDF results show that the CO\u2082 is strongly adsorbed at O atoms of the \u2013NO\u2082 group of ZIF-78 whereas the CH\u2084 is mostly observed at H atoms of the nitroimidazolate linker of ZIF-78, respectively. The self diffusivity of CO\u2082 does not depend on the concentration but it is the case for CH\u2084. From both kinds of selectivity, the significantly higher of adsorption selectivity (8.08) than diffusion selectivity (~0.3) indicates the main contribution of adsorption selectivity in membrane permeability. It demonstrates that using ZIF-78 in equilibrium-based separation will be more efficient than using them in membrane-based separation applications.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2011.1318", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2011.1318", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

The simulations are based on experimentally validated interatomic potentials and employ highly efficiently algorithms for parallel architectures.; The onset of void-void interaction is investigated by performing MD simulations of amorphous silica under hydrostatic tension. The simulations reveal that nanocavities in amorphous silica (a-SiO2), which are linked to Si-O rings, play an important role in void-void coalescence and inter-void ligament failure.; Nanocracks nucleated by the migration of three-fold coordinated Si and nonbridging O on --Si-O-Si-O-- rings are observed in the multimillion MD simulations of a single void in amorphous silica subjected to a high shear rate. With the increase in shear strain, nanocracks appear on void surfaces and the voids deform into a threadlike structure. At a strain of 40%, the voids break into fragments. The results are similar to experimental and theoretical studies of bubble deformation and breakup under shear.; Defects such as voids are known to be important in the detonation of energetic materials. To investigate deformation of a void in an RDX crystal under high shear rate, we have performed million-atom reactive force field (ReaxFF) MD simulations. Simulations reveal that without breaking a bond, the excess strain energy leads to translational and rotational motion of RDX molecules. At a strain of 13%, molecules with high kinetic energy collapse inward without affecting the rest of the system.; MD simulations of nanoindentation in amorphous silica reveal migration of defects and their recombination in the densified plastic region under and the material pileup region around the indenter. The plastic flow of silica glass is related to the defect transport mechanism where a defect migrates a considerable distance via a chain of bond-switching events[44]. We obtained a hardness value of 7.2 GPa using a sharp indenter and 8.0 GPa for a slightly blunt indenter.; We have also performed nanoindentation simulation on a (100) \u00e1-RDX crystal surface using ReaxFF. Simulation reveals localized melting and decomposition of RDX molecular fragments. We have found a distinct (210) plane boundary, where molecules above the (210) plane have displaced dramatically and molecules below the plane remain intact.

The simulations are based on experimentally validated interatomic potentials and employ highly efficiently algorithms for parallel architectures.; The onset of void-void interaction is investigated by performing MD simulations of amorphous silica under hydrostatic tension. The simulations reveal that nanocavities in amorphous silica (a-SiO2), which are linked to Si-O rings, play an important role in void-void coalescence and inter-void ligament failure.; Nanocracks nucleated by the migration of three-fold coordinated Si and nonbridging O on --Si-O-Si-O-- rings are observed in the multimillion MD simulations of a single void in amorphous silica subjected to a high shear rate. With the increase in shear strain, nanocracks appear on void surfaces and the voids deform into a threadlike structure. At a strain of 40%, the voids break into fragments. The results are similar to experimental and theoretical studies of bubble deformation and breakup under shear.; Defects such as voids are known to be important in the detonation of energetic materials. To investigate deformation of a void in an RDX crystal under high shear rate, we have performed million-atom reactive force field (ReaxFF) MD simulations. Simulations reveal that without breaking a bond, the excess strain energy leads to translational and rotational motion of RDX molecules. At a strain of 13%, molecules with high kinetic energy collapse inward without affecting the rest of the system.; MD simulations of nanoindentation in amorphous silica reveal migration of defects and their recombination in the densified plastic region under and the material pileup region around the indenter. The plastic flow of silica glass is related to the defect transport mechanism where a defect migrates a considerable distance via a chain of bond-switching events[44]. We obtained a hardness value of 7.2 GPa using a sharp indenter and 8.0 GPa for a slightly blunt indenter.; We have also performed nanoindentation simulation on a (100) \u00e1-RDX crystal surface using ReaxFF. Simulation reveals localized melting and decomposition of RDX molecular fragments. We have found a distinct (210) plane boundary, where molecules above the (210) plane have displaced dramatically and molecules below the plane remain intact. Simulation also shows the fragmented RDX molecules diffuse from the substrate and walk on the indenter surface.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1464", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1464", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Oseltamivir, the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor blocking the releasing of new viruses, is an effective agent against influenza B virus, however, the oseltamivir resistances conferring the E119G, R152K and D198N substitutions have been reported. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the wild-type and the three NA mutants with oseltamivir bound. Based on three different of MD simulations, the wild-type system is the most stability which oseltamivir strongly binds through the five key residues E119, D151, R152, R292 and R371. The notable loss of hydrogen bond and the decrease in per-residue decomposition energy at the mutated residues G119 and K152 compared to those of the wild-type were found to be the primary source of high-level oseltamivir resistance in the E119G and R152K mutants, respectively. In addition, the larger cavities in the NA active site conferring with these two mutations at the \u2013NH3+ and \u2013NHAc side chains, respectively, were compensated by more accessibility of water molecules. In contrast to the low level oseltamvir resistance in D198N mutant, this strain only showed slightly decreased in hydrogen bonds.

In this work, PET in flavodoxin from Desulfobivrio vulgaris, strain Miyazaki F (FD-DvMF) and from Helicobacter pylori (FD-HP), in which both bind one molecule of FMN as a cofactor, were studied using several molecular modeling techniques. Four FD-DvMF structures (wild type, W59F, Y97F and W59F-Y97F) were generated by homology modeling while the wild type structure of FD-HP was taken from the protein data bank. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of all five systems were carried out to investigate FMN-enzyme binding interaction as well as their dynamic properties. The decomposition free energy calculations indicate that the 10-loop region has the highest contribution to the binding, which is due to the H-bonding between phosphate subsite and amino acids. Ensemble of conformations obtained from the MD simulations of the five systems was supplied into the Kakitani and Mataga theory to analyze the PET mechanisms by fitting with experimental fluorescence quenching data. It was found that the mean electron transfer rate from Trp59 to excited Iso (Iso*) in the wild type was the fastest among the four FD-DvMF and it is from Tyr92 to Iso* for the FD-HP. In addition, the net electrostatic energy and the standard free energy change of the reaction are the most influential factors for the ultrafast electron transfer rate. The charge transfer (CT) was further studied by using quantum chemistry method. The calculations reveal that the state is the locally excited state while the S\u2082 state shows CT state characteristic.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2012.820", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2012.820", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

The NBEs of ligands\u2019 substructures vis-\u00e0-vis active site indicated that pyridyl fragment (F2B4) in L7G and L8G, and amide fragment (F2B5) in LAR and L6G are in high energy states. Based on ligands\u2019 substructures and active site residues properties new compounds were designed by introducing phenolic and amidine moieties, respectively, for F2B4 and F2B5. This improved NBEs of new compounds (NC2, \u201360.93 kcal/mol; NC3, -42.42 kcal/mol). Also, Zn2+ group (substructure F1) of largazoles was modified with that of SAHA and Trapoxin A. Here, the results indicated in favor of Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A. New compound NC6 incorporating aforesaid modifications i.e. phenolic moiety for F2B4, amidine moiety for F2B5 and Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A in F1, offered best interactions with HDAC8 (\u201389.75 kcal/mol).

However, the exact mechanism/s underlying its biological effects are unknown. It has been previously shown that EGCG is capable of binding to and disrupting the membrane, so that some of its effects on biological systems could be ascribed to its capacity to incorporate into the biological membrane and modulate its structure. In this work, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) to discern the location and orientation of EGCG in model membranes and the possible existence of specific interactions with membrane lipids. For that goal, we have used in our simulation two complex model membranes, one resembling the plasma membrane (PM) and the other one the late endosome (LE) membrane. Our results support that EGCG tends to associate with the membrane and exists inside it in a relatively stable and steady location with a low propensity to be associated with other EGCG molecules. Interestingly, EGCG forms hydrogen bonds with POPC and POPE in the PM system but POPC and BMP and no POPE in the LE. These data suggest that the broad beneficial effects of EGCG could be mediated, at least in part, through its membranotropic effects and therefore membrane functioning. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

GPR142, an orphan GPCR, has been implicated in the regulation of insulin, thereby having a crucial role in Type II diabetes management. Deciphering of the structures of orphan, GPCRs (O-GPCRs) offer better prospects for advancements in research in ion translocation and transduction of extracellular signals. As the crystallographic structure of GPR142 is not available in PDB, therefore, threading and ab initio-based approaches were used for 3D modeling of GPR142. Molecular dynamic simulations (900 ns) were performed on the 3D model of GPR142 and complexes of GPR142 with top five hits, obtained through virtual screening, embedded in lipid bilayer with aqueous system using OPLS force field. Compound 1, 3, and 4 may act as scaffolds for designing potential lead agonists for GPR142. The finding of GPR142 MD simulation study provides more comprehensive representation of the functional properties.

The NBEs of ligands\u2019 substructures vis-\u00e0-vis active site indicated that pyridyl fragment (F2B4) in L7G and L8G, and amide fragment (F2B5) in LAR and L6G are in high energy states. Based on ligands\u2019 substructures and active site residues properties new compounds were designed by introducing phenolic and amidine moieties, respectively, for F2B4 and F2B5. This improved NBEs of new compounds (NC2, \u201360.93 kcal/mol; NC3, -42.42 kcal/mol). Also, Zn2+ group (substructure F1) of largazoles was modified with that of SAHA and Trapoxin A. Here, the results indicated in favor of Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A. New compound NC6 incorporating aforesaid modifications i.e. phenolic moiety for F2B4, amidine moiety for F2B5 and Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A in F1, offered best interactions with HDAC8 (\u201389.75 kcal/mol). Thus, the study revealed new depsipeptides as potential HDAC8 inhibitors.

Since the cases of delamination of the coating take place in dental practice, it is very important to estimate the adhesive strength of HAp with the implant. A measure of the coating-to-substrate bond strength is the energy of this bond. In this research, quantum chemistry is used to calculate the binding energy of functional groups (anions) of hydroxyapatite and titanium 2+, which is a standard implant material. First, using Density Functional Theory with Becke three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr hybrid exchange-correlation functional, the lowest potential energy surface is calculated. Then, by ab initio molecular dynamics, the reaction path, the reaction products, frequencies of oscillations, the activation energies and binding energies between various combinations of component anions of HAp and Ti(II) are calculated.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.8227118", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.8227118", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

Apoptotic dysregulation can result in numerous pathological conditions, such as cancers, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegeneration. Members of the BCL-2 family of proteins regulate the process of apoptosis by its promotion or inhibition and overexpression of the pro-survival anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) has been associated with tumor maintenance, growth and progression Small molecules and peptides which bind the BH3 binding groove of these proteins have been explored in the recent times for their anticancer potential. The first anticancer agents targeting this family of proteins were aimed primarily toward inhibition of Bcl-2. An elevated level of Mcl-1, despite Bcl-2 inhibition, continues to be a cause for resistance in most cancers. However, in silico exploration of Mcl-1 specific drugs and their associated mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. In order to understand the same, we have carried out docking and molecular dynamic simulations on ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally active inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w proteins; Obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor as well as Maritoclax, an Mcl-1 specific inhibitor. Docking studies revealed that binding to the hydrophobic grooves is a prerequisite for action on the BCL protein and the binding mechanism and chemical space utilization dictates stability as well as specificity of the inhibitor molecular dynamic simulations showed that on binding, the \u03b1-helices of these proteins exhibited less fluctuations than loop regions, also hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding were observed to be the predominant interactions in the drug-receptor complexes.

However, the exact mechanism/s underlying its biological effects are unknown. It has been previously shown that EGCG is capable of binding to and disrupting the membrane, so that some of its effects on biological systems could be ascribed to its capacity to incorporate into the biological membrane and modulate its structure. In this work, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) to discern the location and orientation of EGCG in model membranes and the possible existence of specific interactions with membrane lipids. For that goal, we have used in our simulation two complex model membranes, one resembling the plasma membrane (PM) and the other one the late endosome (LE) membrane. Our results support that EGCG tends to associate with the membrane and exists inside it in a relatively stable and steady location with a low propensity to be associated with other EGCG molecules. Interestingly, EGCG forms hydrogen bonds with POPC and POPE in the PM system but POPC and BMP and no POPE in the LE. These data suggest that the broad beneficial effects of EGCG could be mediated, at least in part, through its membranotropic effects and therefore membrane functioning. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Contour maps derived from the 3D-QSAR models provided information on main factors towards the activity. Then, we carried out structural optimization and designed several new compounds to improve the predicted biological activity.

Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicated that the predicted ligands were stable in the active site of PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3.

The doxorubicin drug, DOX, in free form (DOXfree) and its complexes both inside (DOXin-SWCNT) and outside (DOXout-SWCNT) the pristine SWCNT were chosen to be the three modeled studied.

The DOX in both complexes was also observed to form the aromatic stacking interaction with the SWCNT surface. Interestingly, the DOX in the DOXin-SWCNT and DOXout-SWCNT complexes were found to move from one end to the other of the SWCNT, parallel to the tube surface at the distance (from the center of mass of the drug to the tube surface) of 4.5 \u00c5 and 4.0 \u00c5, respectively.

At 1 and 1000 bar liquid water which is mostly 4 and 5 coordinated at 280 K becomes 4 coordinated when sufficieintly cooled. Oxygen atoms become more orientationally ordered with cooling and at temperatures less than 230 K its orientation is ice-like.

In general, PCLs consist of a ligand of the target receptor covalently linked to an azobenzene, which can be reversibly switched between two configurations upon light illumination. Gluazo, as a PCL that targets excitatory amino acid receptors, in its dark-adapted trans iso-form was characterized to be a partial agonist of the kainate glutamate receptor GluK2. Application of UV light leads to the formation of the cis form, with remarkedly reduced affinity towards GluK2. The mechanism of the change of ligand affinity induced by the photoisomerization was unresolved. The presented computational study explains how the isomerization of such a PCL affects the structural changes in the target receptor that lead to its activation.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.7r71q", "publicationDate": "2015-09-03", "dateAvailable": "2015-09-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7r71q", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The NBEs of ligands\u2019 substructures vis-\u00e0-vis active site indicated that pyridyl fragment (F2B4) in L7G and L8G, and amide fragment (F2B5) in LAR and L6G are in high energy states. Based on ligands\u2019 substructures and active site residues properties new compounds were designed by introducing phenolic and amidine moieties, respectively, for F2B4 and F2B5. This improved NBEs of new compounds (NC2, \u201360.93 kcal/mol; NC3, -42.42 kcal/mol). Also, Zn2+ group (substructure F1) of largazoles was modified with that of SAHA and Trapoxin A. Here, the results indicated in favor of Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A. New compound NC6 incorporating aforesaid modifications i.e. phenolic moiety for F2B4, amidine moiety for F2B5 and Zn2+ group of Trapoxin A in F1, offered best interactions with HDAC8 (\u201389.75 kcal/mol).

Since the cases of delamination of the coating take place in dental practice, it is very important to estimate the adhesive strength of HAp with the implant. A measure of the coating-to-substrate bond strength is the energy of this bond. In this research, quantum chemistry is used to calculate the binding energy of functional groups (anions) of hydroxyapatite and titanium 2+, which is a standard implant material. First, using Density Functional Theory with Becke three-parameter Lee-Yang-Parr hybrid exchange-correlation functional, the lowest potential energy surface is calculated. Then, by ab initio molecular dynamics, the reaction path, the reaction products, frequencies of oscillations, the activation energies and binding energies between various combinations of component anions of HAp and Ti(II) are calculated.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.8227118.v1", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.8227118.v1", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

Under these conditions we analyse liquid water's local structure and compare it with hexagonal ice.

In raaSAFT both homonuclear and heteronuclear models are implemented for a wide range of compounds spanning from linear alkanes, to more complicated fluids such as water and alcohols, all the way up to nonionic surfactants and models of asphaltenes and resins. Adding new compounds as well as new features is made straightforward by the modularity of the code. To demonstrate the ease-of-use of raaSAFT, we give a detailed walkthrough of how to simulate liquid\u2013liquid equilibrium of a hydrocarbon with water. We describe in detail how both homonuclear and heteronuclear compounds are implemented. To demonstrate the performance and versatility of raaSAFT, we simulate a large polymer-solvent mixture with 300 polystyrene molecules dissolved in 42 700 molecules of heptane, reproducing the experimentally observed temperature-dependent solubility of polystyrene. For this case we obtain a speedup of more than three orders of magnitude as compared to atomistically-detailed simulations.", "doi": "10.17632/cfcwvnpbv3.1", "publicationDate": "2017-03-10", "dateAvailable": "2017-03-10", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cfcwvnpbv3", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

However, for nearly 50 years solar oscillations have been precisely observed, and the wealth of their data has enabled us to study the interior of the Sun as if it were a laboratory. Helioseismology is the name of this branch of astrophysics. It allows a high-precision diagnostic of the thermodynamic quantities in the solar interior. High-quality thermodynamic quantities are crucial for successful solar modeling.; If good solar models are desired, considerable theoretical effort is required. Good solar models, in turn, are fundamental tools for solar physics. The most prominent example of this link between solar physics and basic physics was the resolution of the solar neutrino problem in 2002. The equation of state is a key material property that describes the relation between pressure, density and temperature. If the equation of state is derived from a thermodynamic potential it will also determine all associated thermodynamic quantities. A second key material property is the nuclear-energy production rate, which plays a crucial role in the solar core. Both are important physical properties describing the structure of the Sun. Both derive from microphysical models.; In the equation-of-state part, we have studied two models of the equation of state (EOS). One is the MHD EOS, which is widely used in solar models. In our research, we have incorporated new terms into the MHD EOS. These terms have been borrowed from the major competing formalism, the OPAL EOS. They were missing in the original MHD EOS. Not only do the upgrades bring MHD closer to the OPAL equation of state, which is well known for its better match with observations. Most importantly it will allow solar modelers to use the OPAL equation of state directly, without recourse to the OPAL tables distributed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Since the OPAL code is not publicly available, there is no alternative source. The official OPAL tables, however, have disadvantages. First, they are inflexible regarding the chemical mix, which is set once and for all by the producers of the tables. Our equation of state will allow the user to choose, in principle, an arbitrary mix. Second, the OPAL tables by their very nature are limited by the errors of interpolation within tables. The second equation of state model is a density expansion based on the Feynman-Kac path-integral formalism. By making use of the equivalence of quantum Hamiltonian matrix and the classical action of closed and open filaments (paths), an analytic formalism of equation of state. Although the character of density expansion limits its application, the formalism can still be valid in most region in the Sun. Our work provides the link between the abstract theoretical formalism that was developed in the 1990s and a numerically smooth realization that can be used in solar and stellar models. Since it is so far the most exact and systematic approach for an EOS, it provides another way to study the influence of different very fine physical effects, despite considerable limitations in its domain of applicability.; In the nuclear-reaction part of the thesis, we have used a molecular-dynamics method to simulate the motion of protons in a hydrogen plasma (which is a good approximation for this purpose). Quantum tunneling explains why nuclear fusion can occur in the first place, considering the \"low\" temperature in the solar core. It is well known that this tunneling is enhanced (which leads to higher nuclear reaction rates) in the presence of Coulomb screening. In the 1950, Salpeter formulated a theory based on the static-screened Coulomb potential, as derived by Debye and Huckel in the 1920s. As expected, Salpeter obtained enhanced reaction rates. But from our simulation, we confirmed the results of a recent controversy about the existence of a dynamic effect. Since the bulk of fusion reactions happens at the high end of the Maxwell distribution, this is an relevant issue. Our work is the first independent confirmation of such a dynamic effect.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1775", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1775", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

A potential key player in this process is the protein myoglobin (Mb). Indeed, there is a catalogue of empirical evidence supporting direct interaction of globins with fatty acid metabolites; however, the binding pocket and regulation of the interaction remains to be established. In this study, we employed a computational strategy to elucidate the structural determinants of fatty acids (palmitic & oleic acid) binding to Mb. Sequence analysis and docking simulations with a horse (Equus caballus) structural Mb reference reveals a fatty acid-binding site in the hydrophobic cleft near the heme region in Mb. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid attain a \u201cU\u201d shaped structure similar to their conformation in pockets of other fatty acid-binding proteins. Specifically, we found that the carboxyl head group of palmitic acid coordinates with the amino group of Lys45, whereas the carboxyl group of oleic acid coordinates with both the amino groups of Lys45 and Lys63. The alkyl tails of both fatty acids are supported by surrounding hydrophobic residues Leu29, Leu32, Phe33, Phe43, Phe46, Val67, Val68 and Ile107. In the saturated palmitic acid, the hydrophobic tail moves freely and occasionally penetrates deeper inside the hydrophobic cleft, making additional contacts with Val28, Leu69, Leu72 and Ile111. Our simulations reveal a dynamic and stable binding pocket in which the oxygen molecule and heme group in Mb are required for additional hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism in which Mb acts as a muscle transporter for fatty acid when it is in the oxygenated state and releases fatty acid when Mb converts to deoxygenated state.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.5g1k6", "publicationDate": "2015-06-11", "dateAvailable": "2015-06-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5g1k6", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The upgraded edition of CU-ENUF runs concurrently in a hybrid parallel way that enables the computation parallelizing on multiple computer nodes firstly, then further on the installed GPU in each computer. By this parallel strategy, the size of simulation system will be never restricted to the throughput of a single CPU or GPU. The most critical technical problem is how to parallelize a CUNFFT in the parallel strategy, which is conquered effectively by deep-seated research of basic principles and some algorithm skills. Furthermore, the upgraded method is capable of computing electrostatic interactions for both the atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).

One constitutive ERK activating mutation in B-Raf, the V600E (valine to glutamate) replacement occurring adjacent to a site of threonine phosphorylation (T599) occurs in many types of cancer, and in a large percentage of certain cancers, such as melanoma. Because natural ATP binding activity and the V600E mutation are both known to alter the physical behavior of the activation loop in the ATP binding domain, this system is especially amenable to comparative functional analyses using molecular dynamics of drug classes and genetic variants at all-atom resolution. Here, we employ machine learning enabled identification of functionally conserved protein dynamics to compare how disease pertinent molecular variations impact conserved loop dynamics during the binding of four ATP competitive B-Raf inhibitors (sorafenib, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and PLX7904) that differ in their effectiveness in preventing cancer recurrence. We demonstrate that drug development targeting B-Raf has progressively moved towards ATP competitive inhibitors that demonstrate less tendency to mimic the functional dynamic shifts associated with ATP binding in this domain. We argue this functional dynamic mimicry in first generation B-Raf inhibitors increases the side effect of hyperactivation (i.e. inducing MAPK activation in non-tumorous cells in the absence of secondary mutation). Within the context of the binding interaction of each inhibitor, we compare the functional dynamic impacts of V600E and other sensitizing and drug resistance causing mutations in the activation and P-loops, confirming sites of low mutational tolerance in these two functional regions. Lastly, we investigate V600E sensitivity of B-Raf loop dynamics in an evolutionary context, demonstrating that while it probably shares partial origin with its early evolution in primitive eukaryotes, the functional sensitivity to V600E was secondarily increased during early jawed vertebrate evolution.", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3623150", "publicationDate": "2020-01-22", "dateAvailable": "2020-01-22", "version": null, "accessRights": "info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess", "containerURI": "https://zenodo.org/record/3623150", "method": null, "source": "ZENODO", "type_cont": "article"},

We examine this issue by way of the model protein Gloeobacter violaceous ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) using computational molecular dynamics, with a coarse-grained model to enhance sampling. We find that in flooding simulations, both propofol and a generic particle localize to the crystallographic transmembrane anesthetic binding region, and that propofol also localizes to an extracellular region shared with the crystallographic ketamine binding site. Subsequent simulations to probe these binding modes in greater detail demonstrate that ligand binding induces structural asymmetry in GLIC. Consequently, we employ residue interaction correlation analysis to describe the internal allosteric network underlying the coupling of ligand and distant effector sites necessary for conformational change. Overall, the results suggest that the same allosteric network may underlie the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.sp025", "publicationDate": "2016-08-15", "dateAvailable": "2016-08-15", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sp025", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Hence, study of the interactions between such aptamers and ions can be beneficial to determine the highest selective aptamer toward an ion. In this article, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations have been applied to investigate the selectivity of the T30695 aptamer toward Pb2+ in comparison with some ions. The Free Energy Landscape (FEL) analysis indicates that Pb2+ has remained inside the aptamer during the MD simulation, while the other ions have left it. The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) binding energies prove that the conformational stability of the aptamer is the highest in the presence of Pb2+. According to the compaction parameters, the greatest compressed ion-aptamer complex, and hence, the highest ion-aptamer interaction have been induced in the presence of Pb2+. The contact maps clarify the closer contacts between the nucleotides of the aptamer in the presence of Pb2+. The density functional theory (DFT) results show that Pb2+ forms the most stable complex with the aptamer, which is consistent with the MD results. The QM calculations reveal that the N-H bonds and the O\u2026H distances are the longest and the shortest, respectively, in the presence of Pb2+. The obtained results verify that the strongest hydrogen bonds (HBs), and hence, the most compressed aptamer structure are induced by Pb2+. Besides, atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses confirm the results. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The application is focused on domain decomposition coupling, where a particle and continuum software model different parts of a single simulation domain with information exchange. This focus allows a simple library to be developed, with core mapping and communication handled by just four functions. Emphasis is on scaling on supercomputers, a tested cross-language library, deployment with containers and well-documented simple examples. Building on this core, a template is provided to facilitate the user development of common features for coupling, such as averaging routines and functions to apply constraint forces. The interface code for LAMMPS and OpenFOAM is provided to both include molecular detail in a continuum solver and model fluids flowing through a granular system. Two novel development features are highlighted which will be useful in the development of the next generation of multi-scale software: (i) The division of coupled code into a smaller blocks with testing over a range of processor topologies. (ii) The use of coupled mocking to facilitate coverage of various parts of the code and allow rapid prototyping. These two features aim to help users develop coupled models in a test-driven manner and focus on the physics of the problem instead of just software development.

Experiments coupled with computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) have provided insight into the physics of membranes. We use long\u2010time and large\u2010scale MD simulations to study the structure, dynamics and mechanical behavior of membranes. \u2767 We investigate shock\u2010induced collapse of nanobubbles in water using MD simulations based on a reactive force field. We observe a focused jet at the onset of bubble shrinkage and a secondary shock wave upon bubble collapse. The jet length scales linearly with the nanobubble radius, as observed in experiments on micron\u2010to\u2010millimeter size bubbles. Shock induces dramatic structural changes, including an ice\u2010VII\u2010like structural motif at a particle velocity of 1 km/s. The incipient ice VII formation and the calculated Hugoniot curve are in good agreement with experimental results. We also investigate molecular mechanisms of poration in lipid bilayers due to shock\u2010induced collapse of nanobubbles. Our multimillion\u2010atom MD simulations reveal that the jet impact generates shear flow of water on bilayer leaflets and pressure gradients across them. This transiently enhances the bilayer permeability by creating nanopores through which water molecules translocate rapidly across the bilayer. Effects of nanobubble size and temperature on the porosity of lipid bilayers are examined. \u2767 The second research project focuses on cholesterol (CHOL) dynamics in phospholipid bilayers. Several experimental and computational studies have been performed on lipid bilayers consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and CHOL molecules. CHOL interleaflet transport (flip-flop) plays an important role in interleaflet coupling and determining CHOL flip\u2010flop rate has been elusive. Various studies report that the rate ranges between milliseconds to seconds. We calculate CHOL flip\u2010flop rates by performing a 15 \u03bcs all\u2010atom MD simulation of a DPPC\u2013CHOL bilayer. We find that the CHOL flip\u2010flop rates are on the sub microsecond timescale. These results are verified by performing various independent parallel replica (PR) simulations. Our PR simulations provide significant boost in sampling of the flip\u2010flop events. We observe that the CHOL flip\u2010flop can induce membrane order, regulate membrane\u2010bending energy, and facilitate membrane relaxation. The rapid flip\u2010flop rates reported here have important implications for the role of CHOL in mechanical properties of cell membranes, formation of domains, and maintaining CHOL concentration asymmetry in plasma membrane. Our PR approach can reach submillisecond time scales and bridge the gap between MD simulations and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments on CHOL flip\u2010flop dynamics in membranes. \u2767 The last project deals with transfection barriers encountered by a bare small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a phospholipid bilayer. SiRNA molecules play a pivotal role in therapeutic applications. A key limitation to the widespread implementation of siRNA\u2010based therapeutics is the difficulty of delivering siRNA\u2010based drugs to cells. We have examined structural and mechanical barriers to siRNA passage across a phospholipid bilayer using all\u2010atom MD simulations. We find that the electrostatic interaction between the anionic siRNA and head groups of phospholipid molecules induces a phase transformation from the liquid crystalline to ripple phase. Steered MD simulations reveal that the siRNA transfection through the ripple phase requires a force of ~ 1.5 nN.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-363504", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-363504", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Hence, study of the interactions between such aptamers and ions can be beneficial to determine the highest selective aptamer toward an ion. In this article, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations have been applied to investigate the selectivity of the T30695 aptamer toward Pb2+ in comparison with some ions. The Free Energy Landscape (FEL) analysis indicates that Pb2+ has remained inside the aptamer during the MD simulation, while the other ions have left it. The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) binding energies prove that the conformational stability of the aptamer is the highest in the presence of Pb2+. According to the compaction parameters, the greatest compressed ion-aptamer complex, and hence, the highest ion-aptamer interaction have been induced in the presence of Pb2+. The contact maps clarify the closer contacts between the nucleotides of the aptamer in the presence of Pb2+. The density functional theory (DFT) results show that Pb2+ forms the most stable complex with the aptamer, which is consistent with the MD results. The QM calculations reveal that the N-H bonds and the O\u2026H distances are the longest and the shortest, respectively, in the presence of Pb2+. The obtained results verify that the strongest hydrogen bonds (HBs), and hence, the most compressed aptamer structure are induced by Pb2+.

In classical MD simulations, the interaction between atoms is described by an empirical interatomic potential, so the reliability of the simulation hinges on the accuracy of the underlying potential. Recently, machine learning (ML) based interatomic potentials are gaining attention as they can reproduce potential energy surfaces (PES) of ab initio calculations, with a much lower computational cost. Therefore, an efficient code for training ML potentials and inferencing PES in new configurations would widen the application range of MD simulations. Here, we announce an open-source package, SNU Interatomic Machine-learning PotentiaL packagE-version Neural Network (SIMPLE-NN) that generates and utilizes the ML potential based on the artificial neural network with the Behler\u2013Parrinello type symmetry function as descriptors for the chemical environments. SIMPLE-NN uses the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package and Google Tensorflow for high expandability and efficient training, and also supports the in-house code for quasi-Newton method. Notably, the package features a weighting scheme based on the Gaussian density function (GDF), which significantly improves accuracy and reliability of ML potentials by resolving sampling bias that exists in typical training sets. For MD simulations, SIMPLE-NN interfaces with the LAMMPS package. We demonstrate the performance and usage of SIMPLE-NN with examples of SiO2.", "doi": "10.17632/pjv2yr7pvr.1", "publicationDate": "2019-05-24", "dateAvailable": "2019-05-24", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pjv2yr7pvr", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

The hits obtained have also been found to share structural features with some known antibiotics such as Amoxicillin. Furthermore, MD simulations on the top most hit L1 displayed its stable binding with the enzyme. Thus, this study has proved helpful in proposing novel inhibitors for MurB enzyme that can be tested against various TB strains. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

These two quantities are related by the following simple expression:\n\nA(r) = -kBT ln (g(r)) + C\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the system temperature, and C is a constant as a result of integration.\n\nThe potential derived in the first instance will not reproduce the physics of the reference system so there is an iterative process through which to improve the description of the reference system. This iterative Boltzmann inversion method is summarized by the following equation for a single state:\n\nVi+1(r) = Vi(r) \u2013 \u03b1kBT ln(gi(r)/gt(r))\n\nwhere Vi(r) is the interaction potential after step i, \u03b1 is a scaling factor to prevent large fluctuations in the updated potential, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, gi(r) the trial RDF, gt(r) the target RDF. This method will typically yield a potential that matches the target RDF well; however, the derived potentials tend to be state dependent and non-unique. The resulting potentials derived via this method may not capture the underlying potential, and therefore may lead to significant artifacts when considering other state points not included\nin the original optimization.\n\nMulti-state iterative Boltzmann inversion methods have been developed in order to overcome this limitation. In these methods, a single potential is updated to match structural data over N number of states by using the following:\n\nVi+1(r) = Vi(r) \u2013 (1/N) \u03a3 {\u03b1s(r)kBTs ln(gsi(r)/gst(r))}\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all states, and the \u201cs\u201d script denotes the property at state s. The scaling factor \u03b1s(r) is now a weighting factor for state s, allowing more or less emphasis to be put on this state in the potential update. The\nparameter \u03b1s(r) is set to be a linear function of r such that the potential smoothly approaches zero at the cutoff.", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Transport of binary mixtures of n-alkane and CO2 in carbon nanopores and the effect of various parameters such as temperature, pressure, pore size and length of the system on the separation were investigated. For generating n-alkanes chains Configurational-bias Monte Carlo method was used and combined with the dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics simulation.; The next phase of this work is to study the transport of gas mixtures through nanoporous silicon carbide membranes using molecular dynamics simulation. We develop a new model for nanoporous materials and inorganic membranes, the pore space of which consists of interconnected pores of irregular shapes and sizes. The model is based on the Voronoi tessellation of the atomistic structure of the crystalline or amorphous materials, of which the membrane is made. It generates three-dimensional molecular pore networks with pore-size distributions (PSD) that resemble those of real inorganic nanoporous materials. In addition to being interconnected and having irregular shapes and distributed sizes, the pores also have rough internal surface, which is what one may expect to exist in most real nanoporous materials. To test the validity of the model, we utilize it to model adsorption in three distinct silicon-carbide (SiC) membranes. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are employed to compute adsorption isotherms of nitrogen in the nanoporous SiC membranes. Using at most one adjustable parameter, the simulated isotherms and the experimental data are in very goodagreement.; We also aim to simulate transport properties of our prepared SiC membranes using the feed back that we get from our adsorption simulation. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations used, in order to study transport and separation of two binary mixtures, namely, H2/CO2 and H2/CH4, and compare the results with the experimental data.

Penicillin, cephalosporin and carbapenems along with the inhibitors such as tazobactam, sulbactam and clavulanic acid are prescribed for the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections. Prolonged exposure to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics leads to the development of resistance. The major reason for the \u03b2-lactam resistance in K. pneumoniae is the secretion of the enzyme K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Secretion of KPC-2 and its variant KPC-3 by the K. pneumoniae strains causes resistance to both the substrate imipenem and the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. Hence, molecular docking and dynamics studies were carried out to analyze the resistance mechanism of KPC-2\u2013imipenem and KPC-3\u2013imipenem at the structural level. It reveals that KPC-3-imipenem has the highest c-score value of 4.03 with greater stability than the KPC-2\u2013imipenem c-score value of 2.36. Greater the interaction between the substrate and the \u03b2-lactamase enzyme, higher the chances of hydrolysis of the substrate. Presently available \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors are also ineffective against KPC-3-expressing strains. This situation necessitates the need for development of novel and effective inhibitors for KPC-3. We have carried out the virtual screening process to identify more effective inhibitors for KPC-3, and this has resulted in ZINC48682523, ZINC50209041 and ZINC50420049 as the best binding energy compounds, having greater binding affinity and stability than KPC-3\u2013tazobactam interactions. Our study provides a clear understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance and provides valuable inputs for the development of inhibitors against KPC-3 expressing K. pneumoniae.

To establish the influence of different chemical functional groups on the aggregation pathway of natural asphaltenes, a series of model triphenylene-based compounds were investigated. Synthesized with alkoxy chains of varying length and amide appendages, both with and without an acid terminating moiety, their aggregation kinetics in toluene were studied over several length scales, using a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, complemented with GROMACS molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The chemical structures of the polyaromatic compounds play an important role in their aggregation behavior: non-centrosymmetric model compounds were more prone to aggregation and formed large clusters. Furthermore, polar components appear to have a more significant influence than \u03c0-stacking on the driving force of aggregation, as the large clusters formed were observed to possess multiple configurations. Both amide and acid groups could generate strong attractive forces between molecules, overcoming the energy barrier imposed by the aromatic solvent and molecular core. These conclusions underline a strong structure-function relationship, of a model system examined on multiple size-scales, in a single solvent.

This study has collected the CA2 deficiency causal missense mutations and assessed their pathogenicity using diverse computational programs. The 3D protein models for all missense mutations were built, and analyzed for structural divergence, protein stability, and molecular dynamics properties. We found M-CAP as the most sensitive prediction method to measure the deleterious potential of CA2 missense mutations. Free energy dynamics of tertiary structure models of CA2 mutants with DUET, mCSM, and SDM based consensus methods predicted only 50% of the variants as destabilizing. Superimposition of native and mutant CA2 models revealed the minor structural fluctuations at the amino acid residue level but not at the whole protein structure level. Near native molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated that CA2 causative missense variants result in residue level fluctuation pattern in the protein structure. This study expands the understanding of genotype-protein phenotype correlations underlying CA2 variant pathogenicity and presents a potential avenue for modifying the CA2 deficiency by targeting biophysical structural features of CA2 protein.

This study has collected the CA2 deficiency causal missense mutations and assessed their pathogenicity using diverse computational programs. The 3D protein models for all missense mutations were built, and analyzed for structural divergence, protein stability, and molecular dynamics properties. We found M-CAP as the most sensitive prediction method to measure the deleterious potential of CA2 missense mutations. Free energy dynamics of tertiary structure models of CA2 mutants with DUET, mCSM, and SDM based consensus methods predicted only 50% of the variants as destabilizing. Superimposition of native and mutant CA2 models revealed the minor structural fluctuations at the amino acid residue level but not at the whole protein structure level. Near native molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated that CA2 causative missense variants result in residue level fluctuation pattern in the protein structure. This study expands the understanding of genotype-protein phenotype correlations underlying CA2 variant pathogenicity and presents a potential avenue for modifying the CA2 deficiency by targeting biophysical structural features of CA2 protein.

However, biochemical analysis of some of these Hsp40 J-domain mutants has so far failed to provide major insight into the specific functional changes in Hsp40-Hsp70 interactions. To explore the detailed structural and dynamic properties of the Hsp40 J-domain, 20 ns molecular dynamic simulations of 4 mutants (D9A, D36A, A30T, and F45S) and wild-type J-domain were performed, followed by Hsp70 docking simulations. Results demonstrated that although the Hsp70 interaction mechanism of the mutants may vary, the major structural change was targeted to the critical HPD motif of the J-domain. Our computational analysis fits well with previous yeast genetics studies regarding highlighting the importance of J-domain function in prion propagation.

The \u201cParallel Replica\u201d(ParRep) dynamics is known for allowing to simulate very long trajectories of metastable Langevin dynamics in the materials science community, but it relies on assumptions that can hardly be transposed to the world of biochemical simulations. The later developed \u201cGeneralized ParRep\u201d variant solves those issues, but it was not applied to significant systems of interest so far.\n\nIn this article, we present the program gen.parRep, the first publicly available implementation of the Generalized Parallel Replica method (BSD 3-Clause license), targeting frequently encountered metastable biochemical systems, such as conformational equilibria or dissociation of protein\u2013ligand complexes. It will be shown that the resulting C++ implementation exhibits a strong linear scalability, providing up to 70% of the maximum possible speedup on several hundreds of CPUs.", "doi": "10.17632/dgp8wdgtgt.1", "publicationDate": "2019-02-28", "dateAvailable": "2019-02-28", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dgp8wdgtgt", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Simulations identified the atomistic mechanisms for the nucleation, growth, and healing of wing cracks in a confined precracked glass. Under dynamic compression, frictional sliding of pre-crack surfaces nucleates nanovoids which evolve into nanocrack columns at the pre-crack tip. Nanocrack columns merge to form a wing crack, which grows via coalescence with nanovoids in the direction of maximum compression. The main growth mechanism of the wing crack is shown to be damage induced by the disorder intrinsic to the amorphous structure. Lateral confinement arrests the growth and partially heals the wing crack. Growth and arrest of the wing crack occur repeatedly, as observed in dynamic compression experiments on brittle solids under lateral confinement.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m854", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m854", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

This class of compounds is attributed with very rich nutritional as well as therapeutic values. The present study focuses on a panel of 16 flavonoid molecules that are demonstrated to exhibit various bioactivities like anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory as well as possess antioxidant potential. The electronic basis of these bioactivities is rarely explored, and structural basis of flavonoid-induced cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition has still remained an uncharted area. The current report thus focuses on providing an electronic explanation of these bioactivities using density functional theory-based quantum chemical descriptors. We also attempt to provide a structure\u2013activity relation model for COX by inhibition of these 16 flavonoids using molecular docking. Here, we report molecular dynamics data from 16 flavonoid\u2013COX-2 complexes performed for 50 nanoseconds each that demonstrates key structural and dynamic aspects of flavonoid-based COX inhibition in light of observed experimental facts. Interaction analysis and evaluation of side-chain dynamics presented in current study are well in agreement with the empirical study and is hoped to pave new avenues towards design and development of COX-2 selective chemical agents.

Specifically, we investigated with molecular dynamics: (i) ellagic acid in water and in methanol; (ii) a model of dsDNA in water; (iii) multiple ellagic acids interacting with dsDNA in water and in methanol; (iv) dsDNA with an intercalated ellagic acid in water and in methanol. Moreover, with metadynamics, we explored the unbinding of an intercalated ellagic acid in dsDNA in water and in methanol.", "doi": "10.18742/rdm01-502", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://librarysearch.kcl.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?&docId=44KCL_ALEPH_RDM_DS061299755&query=any,contains,book&vid=kings_v1", "method": null, "source": "bl.kcl", "type_cont": null},

The first set pertains to DFT simulations using the ABINIT software, while the second is for MD simulations using LAMMPS. According to the new theory presented in this paper, pressure-induced amorphization is concomitant with high temperatures and results in local melting of the material. Such molten regions lose their original crystalline structure, and that loss in structural integrity sustains even on cooling. MD studies were utilized to present this phenomenon and the relevant data is included. The theory also provides a new rationale for Raman spectra of amorphized boron carbide, wherein, amorphization causes local volume increase and causes compression in the surrounding crystalline matrix. The new amorphization peaks arise from compressed crystalline material; crystalline peaks migrate (shift) and give rise to the new spectrum. DFT simulations were conducted to estimate such migrations on application of different levels of pressure.

The virtual interaction sites (VIS) method replaces hydrogen atoms by massless virtual interaction sites to eliminate these degrees of freedom while keeping intact nonbonded interactions and the explicit treatment of hydrogen atoms. We have modified the existing VIS algorithm for most lipids in the popular CHARMM36 force field by increasing the hydrogen atom masses at regular intervals in the lipid acyl chains and obtained lipid properties and pore formation free energies in very good agreement with those calculated in simulations without VIS. Our modified VIS scheme enables a 5 fs time step resulting in a significant performance gain for all-atom simulations of membranes. The method has the potential to make longer time and length scales accessible in all-atom simulations of membrane\u2013protein complexes.\n\nThe file set contains individual lipid topologies for virtual interaction sites for standard CHARMM lipids, as well as a README file with instructions on how to implement the VIS algorithm for membranes or membrane-protein complexes\n\nPlease Cite: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00267\n\n ", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.1240161", "publicationDate": "2018-05-31", "dateAvailable": "2018-06-01", "version": null, "accessRights": "info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess", "containerURI": "https://zenodo.org/record/1240161", "method": null, "source": "ZENODO", "type_cont": "article"},

The investigation of short nucleic acid polymers (aptamers) and their interactions provides a greater understanding of biological phenomena. By virtue of their molecular characteristics such as high specificity and affinity, nucleic acid aptamers are amenable to being designed for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.  The goals of this thesis are to create a non-redundant database of protein-RNA interactions, to generate a mechanism for evaluating the success of computationally predicted nucleic acid aptamers, and implement a method of distilling the evolution of a protein-RNA interface during a molecular dynamics simulation down to only the unique conformations. We hypothesized that this may be achieved by creating an algorithm which would reliably assess the similarity of one protein-RNA interface to another protein-RNA interface. When given a list of protein-RNA complexes or in the case of a molecular dynamics simulation, a dry coordinate file, the algorithm correctly locates each protein-RNA interface, examines the interface contacts, geometry and motifs, and performs an all-to-all comparison.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3440", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3440", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The investigation of short nucleic acid polymers (aptamers) and their interactions provides a greater understanding of biological phenomena. By virtue of their molecular characteristics such as high specificity and affinity, nucleic acid aptamers are amenable to being designed for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.  The goals of this thesis are to create a non-redundant database of protein-RNA interactions, to generate a mechanism for evaluating the success of computationally predicted nucleic acid aptamers, and implement a method of distilling the evolution of a protein-RNA interface during a molecular dynamics simulation down to only the unique conformations. We hypothesized that this may be achieved by creating an algorithm which would reliably assess the similarity of one protein-RNA interface to another protein-RNA interface. When given a list of protein-RNA complexes or in the case of a molecular dynamics simulation, a dry coordinate file, the algorithm correctly locates each protein-RNA interface, examines the interface contacts, geometry and motifs, and performs an all-to-all comparison.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3440", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3440", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The ratio of transient cavity volume to solvent volume increases with size of molecules making up the lattice, increasing divergence from SE predictions. This improved mechanistic understanding of diffusion in viscous matrices explains, for example, why organic compounds equilibrate according to SE predictions and water equilibrates more rapidly in aerosols.", "doi": "10.5523/bris.kew7yuaymnif2m388cmpgbg16", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/kew7yuaymnif2m388cmpgbg16/", "method": null, "source": "bl.bristol", "type_cont": null},

To model these processes requires the development and utilization of theories in electronic structure and quantum dynamics. One of the most popular methods for modeling nuclear-electronic dynamics is surface hopping. In this dissertation, surface hopping will be presented in different spotlights. We describe the method along with its advantages, disadvantages, and the contributions we make to improve its reliability and applicability. These efforts are carried out with simple Hamiltonians that can be solved exactly, thus allowing for an assessment of this approximate method. While this is an important step in methods development, modeling the large number of degrees of freedom in realistic systems requires efficient software. We present a software that combines surface hopping with numerically efficient methods for calculating ground and excited state potential energy surfaces\u2014a necessary feature for modeling systems made up of hundreds of atoms and processes lasting up to tens of picoseconds. As part of our contribution to this software, we implement and benchmark an implicit solvent model, including investigating its effects during the nonradiative relaxation in organic conjugated molecules. The ultimate goal is to improve and assess the accuracy of these theoretical tools with the intention of progressing real-life applications. Having said that, a portion of this dissertation explores the early stages of an application called photoactive energetic materials\u2014a field seeking to discover mechanically and electrically insensitive materials that undergo detonation through optical initiation. Our work investigates the optical properties in energetic materials, identified through an experimental collaboration, and is aimed at unveiling design principles to enhance control over the initiation threshold. In summary, we provide a comprehensive view of atomistic simulations of photoexcited molecules, starting from the methods used to describe electronic transitions through a manifold of excited states as a result of photoexcitation, followed by the development of software used to model realistic systems, and finally the use of such tools to discover how desired photophysical properties can be attained for practical use. The final part of this dissertation explores a new and booming field of research in the computational sciences called machine learning. Machine learning is a clever way of attaining calculations of ab initio accuracy at a tiny fraction of the computational cost through the use of statistically trained models. We present an application using machine learning and discuss how the use of this method can change the scope of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-126992", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-126992", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

In particular, fabrication of SiC membranes by pyrolysis of a polymer precursor that contains Si is quite attractive for separation of hydrogen from other gases. It has been quite difficult to extract atomistic-scale information about such SiC membranes, since they are amorphous. The research presented in this dissertation extends the ReaxFF reactive force field to describe the processes involved in the thermal decomposition of hydridopolycarbosilane (HPCS) to form SiC nanoporous membranes. \u2767 First, we carry out quantum mechanical calculations on models meant to capture the important reaction steps and structures. Then, we develop a model of the HPCS polymer and utilize ReaxFF to describe the thermal degradation and decomposition of the polymer as the system is heated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the next step, we use ReaxFF for reactive dynamics of HPCS over a wide range of temperature. We then simulate pyrolysis of the HPCS under conditions that closely mimic the conditions of the fabrication of nanoporous SiC membranes to produce amorphous SiC material. The pyrolysis results and the computed properties of the SiC ceramic are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data. \u2767 To further test the validity of the model and to provide insight into improving the performance of the membrane, extensive MD simulations were carried out to compute the self-diffusivities of H\u2082, CO\u2082 and CH\u2084 in the molecular model of SiC. The results indicate higher values of the diffusivity for H\u2082. The morphology of the amorphous SiC layer is characterized by computing its accessible free volumes and the cavity distributions. \u2767 Finally, we use the molecular model of SiC and non-equilibrium MD simulations in order to study transport and separation in the membrane of two binary gaseous mixtures, namely, H\u2082/CO\u2082 and H\u2082/CH\u2084 at various temperatures and pressure drops, applied externally to the membrane. When compared with our own experimental data, the model is demonstrated to provide accurate predictions for various properties of interest and, in particular, for the separation factors of the mixtures. The model can be used to determine the optimal membrane's thickness.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-283510", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-283510", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

According to the rapid growth of the new multidrug-resistant TB and the fatality of the disease, the development of high efficacy drugs for TB is needed. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) is an essential enzyme for the folate biosynthesis pathway of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. An enzyme DHFR was facilitated in the conversion of substrate dihydrofolate to the product tetrahydrofolate, which is an important precursor for DNA synthesis. Therefore, the inhibition of mtbDHFR enzyme can terminate the synthesis of essential proteins and molecules for the growth of bacteria. In this study, mtbDHFR was selected as a drug target to develop the effective inhibitor for anti-mtbDHFR. This work focuses on the use of molecular modeling to investigate the interactions between the selected ligands on mtbDHFR, which target to identify the binding affinities and the mode of interaction. Quantum chemistry calculations, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to predict the four ternary systems of mtbDHFR complex with NADPH and three difference inhibitors, which are 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative compounds (P1, P157, and P169) and its substrate, dihydrofolate.

The NMR data of the gp41 N-terminal FP in membrane-mimicking environments was used as the initial structures. The simulations revealed that the peptides adopt an \u03b1-helical structure during the entire simulations. In agreement with experimental studies, the helical content of more than 50% was observed for all FPs. However, the C-terminal part of the peptide is unstructured and rather more flexible than the N-terminal. The peptide forms stable complexes with the lipid bilayer by inserting its hydrophobic residues into the hydrophobic membrane core and exposing its polar terminal to water.

For example, simulations of conformational changes during the voltage-induced transition and ion current represent a major challenge that cannot be overcome at present by brute-force molecular dynamics approaches. To progress on this front, we developed and validated a renormalization approach and extended our previously developed coarse grained (CG) model so that it can describe the effect of the membrane potential and electrolyte solutions. Here we apply our model in realistic simulations of the energetics of the Kv1.2 channel.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of viscoelastic polymer enhanced-oil-recovery in nanopores is of great significance for the advancement of oil exploitation. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the detailed process of the viscoelastic polymer displacing oil at the atomic scale. We found that the interactions between polymer chains and oil provide an additional pulling effect on extracting the residual oil trapped in dead-end nanopores, which plays a key role in increasing the oil displacement efficiency. Our results also demonstrate that the oil displacement ability of polymer can be reinforced with the increasing chain length and viscoelasticity. In particular, polymer with longer chain length exhibits stronger elastic property, which enhances the foregoing pulling effect. These findings can help to enrich our understanding on the molecular mechanism of polymer enhanced-oil-recovery and provide guidance for oil extraction engineering.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.61g8620", "publicationDate": "2018-05-21", "dateAvailable": "2018-05-21", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.61g8620", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

As aberration in proteasomal degradation has been implicated in many human diseases, structural analysis of the human 26S proteasome complex is essential to advance our understanding of its action and regulation mechanisms. In recent years, cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for elucidating structural topologies of large protein assemblies, with its unique capability of studying protein complexes in cells. To facilitate the identification of cross-linked peptides, we have previously developed a robust amine reactive sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linker, disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO). To better understand the structure and regulation of the human 26S proteasome, we have established new DSSO-based in vivo and in vitro XL-MS workflows by coupling with HB-tag based affinity purification to comprehensively examine protein-protein interactions within the 26S proteasome. In total, we have identified 447 unique lysine-to-lysine linkages delineating 67 inter-protein and 26 intra-protein interactions, representing the largest cross-link dataset for proteasome complexes. In combination with EM maps and computational modeling, the architecture of the 26S proteasome was determined to infer its structural dynamics. In particular, three proteasome subunits Rpn1, Rpn6 and Rpt6 displayed multiple conformations that have not been previously reported. Additionally, cross-links between proteasome subunits and 15 proteasome interacting proteins including 9 known and 6 novel ones have been determined to demonstrate their physical interactions at the amino-acid level. Our results have provided new insights on the dynamics of the 26S human proteasome and the methodologies presented here can be applied to study other protein complexes.\n\nFor more information about how to reproduce this modeling, see https://salilab.org/26S-PIPs or the README file.", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.496173", "publicationDate": "2017-03-14", "dateAvailable": "2017-08-17", "version": null, "accessRights": "info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess", "containerURI": "https://zenodo.org/record/496173", "method": null, "source": "ZENODO", "type_cont": "article"},

Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages.

This progress has been brought about by improvements in methods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the electronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate approximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use the Born\u2013Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy surface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify stable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions and phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the bottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or sampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and empirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new version of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible framework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using interatomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While the original version of the code (Ceriotti et al., 2014) was developed with a focus on path integral molecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes several new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of algorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force engine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that evaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.", "doi": "10.17632/x792grbm9g.1", "publicationDate": "2018-11-22", "dateAvailable": "2018-11-22", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/x792grbm9g", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

In one year of performing simulations, we were able to reproduce the major results of ion selectivity accumulated in fifty years.

The zero-field hole mobility is shown to increase as the annealing temperature or average molecular weights of samples are increased, in accordance with experimental results. Crystal structure analysis shows that the annealing temperature dependence of the mobility can be attributed to the size and structural order of the crystallites in both the chain-backbone and \u03c0-stacking directions. However, the molecular weight dependence of the mobility cannot be rationalized in the same way. Longer chains are shown to belong to more crystallites in the morphology, suggesting that the crystals become better connected as the molecular weight of the sample increases. We show that engineering samples to have an increased fraction of these long \u201ctie chains\u201d within the morphology improves mobility. As such, we propose that crystal connectivity in the noncrystalline portions of the morphology is similarly important in determining carrier mobility as crystallite size and order for semicrystalline conjugated polymers.,", "doi": "10.15128/8k71nh08w", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "All rights reserved", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.15128%2F8k71nh08w", "method": null, "source": "bl.durham", "type_cont": null},

In the study, we applied the computational pipeline of molecular docking followed by the molecular dynamics simulations to shortlist potential \u03b2dGT protein targets. The analysis of protein dynamics and the binding free energy (\u0394G) led us to the identification of HK4 as a key \u03b2dGT target, whereby the binding mode and domain dynamics suggested the activator function of \u03b2dGT. \u03b2dGT bound to the allosteric site of the isozyme \u223c13 \u00c5 away from the substrate (glucose)-binding site. The binding free energy of the ligand-protein complex was energetically feasible (\u0394G, \u201341.61 kcal/mol) and the cleft angle deviation between the two (small and large) domains of HK4 revealed differential HK4 dynamics in response to \u03b2dGT binding. 3D structure analysis of the isozyme-ligand complex highlighted the role of Arg63, Glu67 and Lys458 in ligand stabilization and hydrophobic interactions mediated by Tyr214 and Met235. Experimental validation of the results of computational analysis confirmed the activator function of \u03b2dGT on HK4.

Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for nanoindentation on the crystalline cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) and sulfur-induced embrittlement at nickel grain boundaries.; Multimillion-atom molecular dynamics simulations of nanoindentation on 3C-SiC surfaces corresponding to three different crystallographic directions, (110), (001), and (111), have been performed using pyramidal-shaped Vickers indenter with 90\u02da edge angle. Load-displacement (P-h) curves show major and minor pop-in events during loading. Our analysis shows that the first minor discontinuity in the P-h curve of (110) indentation is related to nucleation of dislocations, whereas the subsequent major load-drops are related to the dissipation of accumulated energy by expansion of dislocation loops and changes of slip planes. Detailed quantitative analysis on the stress distribution on slip planes and stress concentration at kinks and dislocation cores has estimated the Peierls stress to be 7.5GPa~0.039G , where G is the shear modulus. We have observed anisotropic pileup patterns which all reside on (111) and (-1-11)  slip planes after the indenter is unloaded. These patterns are closely related to dislocation activities on the two slip planes. The anisotropy is a consequence of the asymmetry of the 3C-SiC crystal in which only (111) and (-1-11)  slip planes are active out of {111} family.; Alteration of fracture behaviors of a material by minute segregated impurities at grain boundaries is a fundamental question encompassing chemistry, mechanics and material science. One of the well-known examples is sulfur segregation-induced embrittlement of nickel grain boundaries, where coincidence between the critical sulfur concentration for embrittlement and that for amorphization remains unexplained. We have performed 48 million-atom reactive molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations to investigate the role of sulfur. A direct link between sulfur-induced intergranular amorphization and embrittlement is thus established. Analysis shows that an order-of-magnitude reduction of grain-boundary shear strength due to amorphization, combined with tensile-strength reduction, allows the crack tip to always find an easy propagation path. This mechanism explains an experimentally observed crossover from transgranular to intergranular fracture and suppressed plastic activities due to sulfur segregation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m2685", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m2685", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The pulses with the time period of 0-30 \uf06dsec was applied under the periodic boundary condition. The ion density distribution was determined by the Maxwell\u2019s and Lorentz force equations. The electrical pulse did not affect the ion density distribution when the frequency of the pulses was higher than the plasma frequency. The study simulated and analyzed the penetration of the ions in the crystalline medium by employing the molecular dynamic model. The universal ZBL long range potential and the Lennard Jones short range potential were considered in order to determine the interatomic force in the crystalline material, which impeded the motion of an ion in the medium. For this study, the molecular dynamic model was numerically implemented to determine the ion range and to describe the effect on the motion of an ion in the medium. Since the ion range in the lattice medium evaluated by this model was found to be comparable to the result obtained from the standard TRIM/SRIM code, it was concluded that the molecular model was adequate for the calculation of the ion range with the advantage that the motion of an ion in the crystalline medium could also be analyzed. The developed model was then used to describe the ion coating process on the target. The layers of the coating ions were classified based on the ion range and the ions density distribution as the coating layer, the mixed layer and the basement layer. The model could be used to predict the thickness of the mixed layer and the ion intensity in the coating layer for the given ion energy. The time needed to create the mixed and the coating layers with the desired thickness and density could also be calculated.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2008.1583", "publicationDate": "2008-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2008.1583", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

The physical and chemical mechanisms affecting the ionization efficiency of evolved gas molecules are not fully understood. We have developed a numerical model for simulating the dynamics of gas molecules evolved from aerosol particles. The simulation model is composed of two main sections. The first section simulates the elastic collisions of the evolved gas molecules in a small region near the vaporization source (collision domain), where the mean free paths of the molecules are much shorter than those in the surrounding high vacuum environment. The second section simulates the free-molecular dynamics from the boundary of the first section to the ionizer. The ionization efficiencies of ammonia and hydrogen iodide molecules that evolved from ammonium iodide particles were evaluated. Our results suggest that the molecular collisions during the early stage of plume expansion and possible changes in the molecular velocities induced by these collisions could be an important mechanism affecting the observed variability in the ionization efficiency. However, the physical and chemical processes of the vaporization and ionization of aerosol particles in TDAMSs may be too complex to be quantitatively reproduced using simplified numerical models.

The analysis of protein dynamics and the binding free energy (\u0394G) led us to the identification of HK4 as a key \u03b2dGT target, whereby the binding mode and domain dynamics suggested the activator function of \u03b2dGT. \u03b2dGT bound to the allosteric site of the isozyme \u223c13 \u00c5 away from the substrate (glucose)-binding site. The binding free energy of the ligand-protein complex was energetically feasible (\u0394G, \u201341.61 kcal/mol) and the cleft angle deviation between the two (small and large) domains of HK4 revealed differential HK4 dynamics in response to \u03b2dGT binding. 3D structure analysis of the isozyme-ligand complex highlighted the role of Arg63, Glu67 and Lys458 in ligand stabilization and hydrophobic interactions mediated by Tyr214 and Met235. Experimental validation of the results of computational analysis confirmed the activator function of \u03b2dGT on HK4.

We conducted the first range-wide genetic assessment of snow leopards based on noninvasive scat surveys. Thirty-three microsatellites were genotyped and a total of 683-bp of mitochondrial DNA sequenced in 70 individuals. Snow leopards exhibited low genetic diversity at microsatellites (AN = 5.8, HO = 0.433, HE = 0.568), virtually no mtDNA variation, and underwent a bottleneck in the Holocene (~8,000 years ago) coinciding with increased temperatures, precipitation, and upward treeline shift in the Tibetan Plateau. Multiple analyses supported three primary genetic clusters: (1) Northern (the Altai region), (2) Central (core Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau), and (3) Western (Tian Shan, Pamir, trans-Himalaya regions). Accordingly, we recognize three subspecies, P. u. irbis (Northern group), P. u. uncia (Western group), and P. u. uncioides (Central group) based upon genetic distinctness, low levels of admixture, unambiguous population assignment, and geographic separation. The patterns of variation were consistent with desert-basin \"barrier effects\" of the Gobi isolating the northern subspecies (Mongolia), and the trans-Himalaya dividing the central (Qinghai, Tibet, Bhutan, and Nepal) and western subspecies (India, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan). Hierarchical Bayesian clustering analysis revealed additional subdivision into a minimum of six proposed management units: western Mongolia, southern Mongolia, Tian Shan, Pamir-Himalaya, Tibet-Himalaya, and Qinghai, with spatial autocorrelation suggesting potential connectivity by dispersing individuals up to ~ 400 km.

However, ab initio theory only deals with the electronic part of the problem (in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation); whereas in experiment a complete interacting molecular system is observed. Nuclear dynamics plays a critical role in understanding the experimental data and cannot be excluded from consideration. Solving the nuclear problem at the same level as the electronic part can be solved is prohibitively expensive with the current computational tools even for small molecules.; The focus of the work presented in this thesis is on filling the gap between advanced ab initio techniques and state of the art experiments by creative use of simple models and approximations for nuclear dynamics to interpret the observed data. A brief overview of the methods is given in Chapter 1.; In Chapters 2-4 we discuss the effect of a high molecular symmetry on the topology of the potential energy surfaces. In particular, the difference between conical and glancing intersections, and how both types of intersections shape the photoelectron spectra and the dissociation dynamics.

Thus, NS3/4A and both wild-type (WT) and H274Y mutant of NA subtypes H5N1 and pH1N1 were focused. Initially, NS3/4A binding to the current inhibitors (boceprevir, telaprevir, danoprevir as well as NA bound with laninamivir were studied in order to investigate their binding pattern and ligand-target interactions as well as the binding efficiency using the conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The per-residue decomposition energy was calculated by molecular mechanics (MM)/generalized Born surface area (GBSA) indicating that the residues 41-43, 57, 81, 136-139, 155-159 and 168 of NS3/4A and 118-119, 151-152, 178, 224, 227, 276, 292 and 371 of all 4 NAs are the key binding residues. Van der Waals interaction is the main contribution to NS3/4A protease inhibitors binding, whereas the main contribution stabilized laninamivir binding is electrostatic interaction. Since some side effects have been observed in patients who treated by approved anti-HCV drugs, the new potent NS3/4A inhibitors have been needed. Therefore the potent inhibitors against NS3/4A were searched from the collected 40 ZINC ligands using steered MD technique based on the hypothesis that the high rupture force is needed for the high efficiency ligand. It was found that 9 top-hit compounds were probably good as or better than the 4 current NS3/4A inhibitors. Based on the SCC-DFTB/MM MD simulation, the acylation step of NS3/4A binding to beceprevir and telaprevir was occurred in the concerted manner as same as the native substrates which their energy barriers for the backward reaction of both systems were 19-23 kcal/mol approximately.

The physical and chemical mechanisms affecting the ionization efficiency of evolved gas molecules are not fully understood. We have developed a numerical model for simulating the dynamics of gas molecules evolved from aerosol particles. The simulation model is composed of two main sections. The first section simulates the elastic collisions of the evolved gas molecules in a small region near the vaporization source (collision domain), where the mean free paths of the molecules are much shorter than those in the surrounding high vacuum environment. The second section simulates the free-molecular dynamics from the boundary of the first section to the ionizer. The ionization efficiencies of ammonia and hydrogen iodide molecules that evolved from ammonium iodide particles were evaluated. Our results suggest that the molecular collisions during the early stage of plume expansion and possible changes in the molecular velocities induced by these collisions could be an important mechanism affecting the observed variability in the ionization efficiency. However, the physical and chemical processes of the vaporization and ionization of aerosol particles in TDAMSs may be too complex to be quantitatively reproduced using simplified numerical models.

The actual ground-state is face-centered-cubic. We find that isotopes of lithium, under identical thermal paths, exhibit a large difference in martensitic transition temperature.

Among the different brain structures investigated for localization of memory formation, such as hippocampus and amygdala, the cerebellum has been widely accepted as serving the neural basis for classical eyeblink conditioning. A growing body of evidence suggests that both cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei contribute to learning and memory of eyeblink conditioning. In this study, the role of the mammalian cerebellum was extensively examined in a novel mice model system with Purkinje cell deficiency. Glucose-regulated protein (GRP, 78kDa) conditional knockout mice demonstrated impaired learning with aberrant timing and amplitude of the conditioned response, and the interpositus nucleus was found to be crucial for expression of conditioned response. In addition, the molecular mechanism of cerebellar learning was investigated using immediate-early gene protein detection in the rat cerebellum following a single training session of eyeblink conditioning. c-Fos protein, a regulatory transcription factor, was detected in the Purkinje cells of the rat cerebellum perfused 1 hour after the onset of training. Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) was significantly increased in the cerebellar cortex when compared to na\u00efve or pseudoconditioned animals. Also, Stargazin expression was increased following training, which reinforces the notion that Stargazin is required for synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Together, these studies extend previous findings of the role of cerebellum and the molecular dynamics underlying the establishment of memory trace in the mammalian cerebellum.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m2982", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m2982", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations and single channel recordings, we show that ethanol interacts with a negatively charged amino acid within an extracellular region of the neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), thereby altering its global conformation and reducing the single channel current amplitude. Charge reversal of the negatively charged amino acid abolishes the nAChR-ethanol interaction. Moreover, using transgenic animals harboring the charge-reversal mutation, ex vivo measurements of muscle force production show that ethanol counters fatigue in wild type but not homozygous \u03b1E83K mutant animals. In accord, in vivo studies of motor coordination following ethanol administration reveal an approximately twofold improvement for wild type compared to homozygous mutant animals. Together, the converging results from molecular to animal studies suggest that ethanol counters muscle fatigue through its interaction with neuromuscular nAChRs.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.413d4t5", "publicationDate": "2019-01-03", "dateAvailable": "2019-01-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.413d4t5", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The hard knock-on and soft knock-on models, which rely on different water and ion configurations, have been offered as competing theories of ion coordination. In order to study the mechanism of selective ion permeation, the bacterial potassium-selective ion channel, KcsA, was used in the investigation described in this thesis. Molecular dynamics was employed using a novel, dynamic approach with constant velocity pulling. In the set-up, two potassium are pulled through the selectivity filter at fifteen discrete ion separation distances in both inward and outward directions to generate a free-energy profile, or two-dimensional potentials of mean force (2D PMF). The energetics of the pathway are calculated using analysis methods that call upon using weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) equations and the Minh-Adib (MA) bidirectional estimator to determine the mechanism of permeation. The constant velocity procedure is replicated with the replacement of one potassium ion for a sodium ion to generate a second 2D PMF profile, such that the mechanism of ion selectivity may be revealed by comparison of the two 2D PMF profiles. Other parameters of the simulations are then explored, drawing from the dynamical nature of the approach, to better understand how the channel operates. Preliminary findings suggest a compromise between the hard and soft knock-on models.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-423576", "publicationDate": "2017-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-423576", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10-100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.", "doi": "10.25675/10217/186709", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": "2018-03-30", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://mountainscholar.org/handle/10217/186709", "method": null, "source": "dcco.csu", "type_cont": null},

The program executes an algorithm for the creation and relaxation of large, dense or diluted homogeneous many particle systems made of wormlike, finite extendable, semiflexible multibead chains and \u2013 optionally \u2013 solvent particles, which repulse each other. The key feature is its efficiency, its output has been proven to serve as an excellent basis for any subsequent off-lattice computer simulation. The application allows to choose (i) the bead number density or packing fraction, temperature, chain length, system size, concentration, (ii) the interaction potentials, hence the local features such as bond length and bending rigidity of the chains, and (iii) the degree of pre-relaxation, parametrized and expressed through a minimum intermolecular distance. The monodisperse polymers are represented by chains of monomer coordinates in 3D space. During the dynamical two-step process of sample creation the initially (Monte Carlo step 1) predicted global characteristics of the molecular conformations remain as unaffected as possible (during molecular dynamics step 2) and the potential energy and the entropy production are relaxing towards their minima. The potentials, the distribution of bond lengths, the integration time step and temperature are smoothly controlled during the creation/relaxation process until they finally approach their prescribed or physical values. The quality of the algorithm is by its nature independent of concentration, system size or degree of polymerization; the CPU speed is quite independent of the latter quantity and linear in the system size. Chains tethered to a surface (dry polymer brushes) can be generated as well.\n\nThe previous version of this program (ADJU_v1_0) may be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-4655(98)00160-X.", "doi": "10.17632/5kgz4bmt2h.1", "publicationDate": "2019-04-23", "dateAvailable": "2019-04-23", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5kgz4bmt2h", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

To date, FDA-approved licensed HSV vaccine is not available yet. Hence, the study was conducted to identify and characterize an effective epitope based polyvalent vaccine against both types of Herpes Simplex Virus. The selected proteins were retrieved from ViralZone and assessed to design highly antigenic epitopes by binding analyses of the peptides with MHC class-I and class-II molecules, antigenicity screening, transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis and molecular docking approach. The final vaccine was constructed by the combination of top CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes from each protein along with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Physicochemical and secondary structure analysis, disulfide engineering, molecular dynamic simulation and codon adaptation were further employed to develop a unique multi-epitope peptide vaccine. Docking analysis of the refined vaccine structure with different MHC molecules and human immune TLR-2 receptor demonstrated higher interaction. Complexed structure of the modeled vaccine and TLR-2 showed minimal deformability at molecular level. Moreover, translational potency and microbial expression of the modeled vaccine was analyzed with pET28a(+) vector for E. coli strain K12 and the vaccine constructs had no similarity with entire human proteome. The study enabled design of a novel chimeric polyvalent vaccine to confer broad range immunity against both HSV serotypes.

The configurations were explored by employing the Minima Hopping Method (MHM) coupled to a machine-learning interatomic potential, that is based on a charge equilibration scheme steered by a neural network (CENT). The combination of these powerful methods revealed about 80 different morphologies for the (100) surface with very similar surface formation energies differing by not more than 0.3 J m\u22122. To take into account the effect of temperature on the dynamics of this surface as well as to study the solid\u2013liquid transformation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in the canonical (NVT) ensemble. By analyzing the atomic mean-square displacements (MSD) of the surface layer in the temperature range of 300\u20131200 K, it was found that in the surface region the F sublattice is less stable and more diffusive than the Ca sublattice. Based on these results we demonstrate that not only a bulk system, but also a surface can exhibit a sublattice premelting that leads to superionicity. Both the surface sublattice premelting and surface premelting occur at temperatures considerably lower than the bulk values. The complex behaviour of the (100) surface is contrasted with the simpler behavior of other low index crystallographic surfaces.", "doi": "10.24435/materialscloud:2020.0018/v1", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "dateAvailable": "2020-01-31", "version": null, "accessRights": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode,info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess,", "containerURI": "https://archive.materialscloud.org/2020.0018/v1", "method": null, "source": "ethz.marvel", "type_cont": null},

Plausible models should be flexible enough to capture changes in the collective behaviour of animal groups at their different developmental stages and group sizes. Here, we analyse the statistical properties of schooling fish (Pseudomugil signifer) through a combination of experiments and simulations. We make novel use of a Boltzmann inversion method, usually applied in molecular dynamics, to identify the effective potential of the mean force of fish interactions. Specifically, we show that larger fish have a larger repulsion zone, but stronger attraction, resulting in greater alignment in their collective motion. We model the collective dynamics of schools using a self-propelled particle model, modified to include varying particle speed and a local repulsion rule. We demonstrate that the statistical properties of the fish schools are reproduced by our model, thereby capturing a number of features of the behaviour and development of schooling fish.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8g0d0", "publicationDate": "2017-03-22", "dateAvailable": "2017-03-22", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8g0d0", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

This severely limits the practical application of these models in systems with dynamics governed by important rare events, such as chemical reactions and diffusion. We present an adaptive Bayesian inference method for automating the training of interpretable, low-dimensional, and multi-element interatomic force fields using structures drawn on the fly from molecular dynamics simulations. Within an active learning framework, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to accept the model prediction or to perform a first principles calculation to augment the training set of the model. The method is applied to a range of single- and multi-element systems and shown to achieve a favorable balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, while requiring a minimal amount of ab initio training data.

While adaptation to constant environments has been well characterized, the effects of environmental complexity remain seldom studied. One simple but understudied factor is the rate of environmental change. Here we used experimental evolution with RNA viruses to investigate whether evolutionary dynamics varied based on the rate of environmental turnover. We used whole-genome next-generation sequencing to characterize evolutionary dynamics in virus populations adapting to a sudden versus gradual shift onto a novel host cell type. In support of theoretical models, we found that when populations evolved in response to a sudden environmental change, mutations of large beneficial effect tended to fix early, followed by mutations of smaller beneficial effect; as predicted, this pattern broke down in response to a gradual environmental change. Early mutational steps were highly parallel across replicate populations in both treatments. The fixation of single mutations was less common than sweeps of associated \u201ccohorts\u201d of mutations, and this pattern intensified when the environment changed gradually. Additionally, clonal interference appeared stronger in response to a gradual change.

This also marks the end of the free-ride era--scientific software must now evolve with new chips. Hence, it is of great importance to develop large legacy-code optimization frameworks to achieve an optimal system architecture-algorithm mapping that maximizes processor utilization and thereby achieves higher application performance. \u2767 To address this challenge, this thesis studies and develops scalable algorithms for leveraging many-core resources optimally to improve the performance of massively parallel scientific applications. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize scientific codes on emerging architectures, which consists of three major steps: (1) Develop a performance profiling framework to identify application performance bottlenecks on clusters of emerging architectures; (2) explore common algorithmic kernels in a suite of real world scientific applications and develop performance tuning strategies to provide insight into how to maximally utilize underlying hardware; and (3) unify experience in performance optimization to develop a top-down optimization framework for the optimization of scientific applications on emerging high-performance computing platforms. \u2767 This thesis makes the following contributions. First, we have designed and implemented a performance analysis methodology for Cell-accelerated clusters. Two parallel scientific applications--lattice Boltzmann (LB) flow simulation and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation--are analyzed and valuable performance insights are gained on a Cell processor based PlayStation3 cluster as well as a hybrid Opteron+Cell based cluster similar to the design of Roadrunner--the first petaflop supercomputer of the world. Second, we have developed a novel parallelization framework for finite-difference time-domain applications. The approach is validated in a seismic-wave propagation simulation code on BlueGene/L, BlueGene/P and x86 quad-core processor based clusters. In addition, we have developed strategies for in-core optimization of the algorithmic kernel of this application, which is a high-order stencil computation--a common kernel to a spectrum of finite-differences based applications. Third, we have applied this systematic approach to a production level first-principles molecular-dynamics application, which has achieved a record of 2.58\u00d710\u00b9\u00b2 electronic degrees of freedom on 163,840 BlueGene/P processors.

A scalable parallel MD algorithm incorporating first principles-based reactive force fields (ReaxFF) has been implemented to perform multimillion-to-billion atom chemically reactive MD simulations.; Mechanical stimuli in energetic materials initiate chemical reactions at shock fronts prior to detonation. Multimillion-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations are performed to investigate atomistic mechanisms of shock-induced reaction initiation in 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) crystal. The simulation reveals a bi-modal molecular response against a planar shock loading, which creates a nanoscale layered-structure of molecular dipole behind a shock front.; The sensitivity of energetic crystals changes with defects such as voids, grain boundaries and cracks. By performing million-atom ReaxFF-MD simulations, the effects of microstructures in crystal on shock sensitivity have been investigated. MD simulation reveals the formation of a nanojet which focuses into a narrow beam as the void collapses. By increasing particle velocity, a pinning-depinning transition of the shock wave front at the void occurs. Shock loading simulation in a nanophase RDX crystal reveals a deformation mechanism that is mediated by molecular reorientation and conformation changes. Molecular rotation and deformation significantly reduce the energy barrier for the onset of slip.; In contrast to crystalline solids, damage, flow and fracture in glass are still controversial areas. We have performed multimillion-atom MD simulations to investigate initiation and growth of wing cracks in confined silica glass. Under dynamic compression, frictional sliding of precrack surfaces nucleates nanovoids which evolve into nanocrack columns at the precrack tip. Nanocrack columns merge to form a wing crack, which grows via coalescence with nanovoids in the direction of maximum compression.; Multimillion-to-billion-atom MD simulations are performed on nanovoid array under hydrostatic tension.

To date, FDA-approved licensed HSV vaccine is not available yet. Hence, the study was conducted to identify and characterize an effective epitope based polyvalent vaccine against both types of Herpes Simplex Virus. The selected proteins were retrieved from ViralZone and assessed to design highly antigenic epitopes by binding analyses of the peptides with MHC class-I and class-II molecules, antigenicity screening, transmembrane topology screening, allergenicity and toxicity assessment, population coverage analysis and molecular docking approach. The final vaccine was constructed by the combination of top CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes from each protein along with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Physicochemical and secondary structure analysis, disulfide engineering, molecular dynamic simulation and codon adaptation were further employed to develop a unique multi-epitope peptide vaccine. Docking analysis of the refined vaccine structure with different MHC molecules and human immune TLR-2 receptor demonstrated higher interaction. Complexed structure of the modeled vaccine and TLR-2 showed minimal deformability at molecular level. Moreover, translational potency and microbial expression of the modeled vaccine was analyzed with pET28a(+) vector for E. coli strain K12 and the vaccine constructs had no similarity with entire human proteome. The study enabled design of a novel chimeric polyvalent vaccine to confer broad range immunity against both HSV serotypes.

In E. coli, SurA comprises three domains: a core domain and two peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains (P1 and P2). The functional roles of these domains in chaperone activity, including their inter-subunit dynamics and interactions with substrates remain unclear. Here we have used chemical cross-linking, HDX-MS, oxidative labelling, single-molecule FRET and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the conformational dynamics of SurA in its apo state and to map the binding site(s) for its clients. We demonstrate that SurA predominantly samples conformations in solution in which the P2 domain is closer to the core and P1 domains than suggested by the extended conformation in its crystal structure. Using cross-linking experiments we show that SurA has multiple, yet specific, binding sites for OmpX located primarily in the core domain, and that residues spanning the whole OmpX sequence bind in these regions. HDX experiments additionally reveal that binding of OmpX, and the larger client OmpF, lead to inter-domain conformational changes between the core and P1 domains. Combining these data we generate a model for SurA OMP recognition in which unfolded OMP substrates bind in a cradle formed between the SurA domains, in a manner reminiscent of other ATP-independent chaperones. Structural flexibility between domains is likely a key feature of the SurA functional cycle, assisting in OMP recognition, binding and release of its broad range of OMP substrates for folding into the outer membrane.", "doi": "10.5518/701", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)", "containerURI": "http://archive.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/650/", "method": null, "source": "bl.leeds", "type_cont": null},

Based on the functional role, 36 and 83 genes that are involved in biofilm formation of A. baumannii and P. areugenosa respectively were selected and metabolic network was computationally constructed. The genes that lack three-dimensional structures were predicted and validated. Carbon nano-fullerene selected as lead molecule and their drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetics properties were computationally predicted. The binding potential of carbon nano-fullerene toward selected drug targets was modeled and compared with the binding of conventional drugs, doripenem, and polymyxin-B with their usual targets. The stabilities of four best-docked complexes were confirmed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. This study suggested that selected genes demonstrated relevant interactions in the constructed metabolic pathways. Carbon fullerene exhibited significant binding abilities to most of the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of last-resort antibiotics and their usual target. The four best ligand\u2013receptor interactions predicted by molecular docking revealed that stability throughout MD simulation. Notably, carbon fullerene exhibited profound binding with outer membrane protein (OmpA) and ribonuclease-HII (rnhB) of A. baumannii and 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone synthase (pqsBC) and chemotaxis protein (wspA) of P. aeruginosa. Thus, the current study suggested that carbon fullerene was probably used as potential lead molecules toward selected targets of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa and the applied aspects probably scaled up to design promising lead molecules toward these pathogens.

As the crystal grows, the solute molecules are drawn from the solution to the crystal, leading to a continuous drop in the solution concentration. This is in contrast to experiments in which the crystal grows at an approximately constant supersaturation of a bulk solution. Recently, Perego et al. [J. Chem. Phys.2015, 142, 144113] showed that in a periodic setup in which the crystal is represented as a slab, the concentration in the vicinity of the two surfaces can be kept constant while the molecules are drawn from a part of the solution that acts as a molecular reservoir. This method is quite effective in studying crystallization under controlled supersaturation conditions. However, once the reservoir is depleted, the constant supersaturation conditions cannot be maintained. We propose a variant of this method to tackle this depletion problem by simultaneously dissolving one side of the crystal while letting the other side grow. A continuous supply of particles to the solution due to the crystal dissolution maintains a steady solution concentration and avoids reservoir depletion. In this way, a constant supersaturation condition can be maintained for as long as necessary. We have applied this method to study the growth and dissolution of urea crystal from water solution under constant supersaturation and undersaturation conditions, respectively. The computed growth and dissolution rates are in good agreement with those obtained in previous studies.", "doi": "10.24435/materialscloud:2020.0015/v1", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01", "dateAvailable": "2020-01-28", "version": null, "accessRights": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode,info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess,", "containerURI": "https://archive.materialscloud.org/2020.0015/v1", "method": null, "source": "ethz.marvel", "type_cont": null},

Ceramics are important engineering materials for their outstanding hardness. One of the most widely used ceramics is alumina, a candidate for armor in defense and aerospace industry. Deformation and fracture mechanisms in alpha-alumina under hypervelocity impact up to 18km/s are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations containing 540-million atoms. Impacting projectile causes melting and local amorphization of the substrate in a spherical surrounding region. Away from the impact face, a wide range of deformations emerge and disappear under the influence of local stress fields, e.g., basal and pyramidal slips, basal and rhombohedral twins, which show good agreement with the experimental and theoretical results. Furthermore, new deformation modes such as twin along {0-111} are observed, and the relation between deformation patterns and local stress levels are probed. During unloading, micro-cracks nucleate extensively at the intersections of previous deformations. These micro-cracks grow and coalesce to form fractures under tensile stresses by the unloading wave. The substrate eventually fails along the surface of an hourglass-shaped region, when spallation ejects clusters of substrate material into the vacuum. We also carried out planar shock simulations of alpha-alumina single crystal and nanophase systems.

In this paper, the c-C4F8 and c-C4F8/N2 gas mixture models were built to study its decomposition process by the combination of reactive molecular dynamics method and density functional theory. The yield of the main decomposition products, the reaction pathways and enthalpy under different temperatures were explored. It was found that the decomposition of c-C4F8/N2 mainly produces CF2, F, CF3, CF, C, CF4 and C2F4. c-C4F8 can decompose to C2F4 by absorbing 43.28 kcal/mol, which is the main decomposition path and this process easily occurs under high temperature.

Based on the functional role, 36 and 83 genes that are involved in biofilm formation of A. baumannii and P. areugenosa respectively were selected and metabolic network was computationally constructed. The genes that lack three-dimensional structures were predicted and validated. Carbon nano-fullerene selected as lead molecule and their drug-likeliness and pharmacokinetics properties were computationally predicted. The binding potential of carbon nano-fullerene toward selected drug targets was modeled and compared with the binding of conventional drugs, doripenem, and polymyxin-B with their usual targets. The stabilities of four best-docked complexes were confirmed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. This study suggested that selected genes demonstrated relevant interactions in the constructed metabolic pathways. Carbon fullerene exhibited significant binding abilities to most of the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of last-resort antibiotics and their usual target. The four best ligand\u2013receptor interactions predicted by molecular docking revealed that stability throughout MD simulation.

As a polyelectrolyte, RNA is negatively charged and requires the presence of positive counterions to condense into the specific, folded structures that are necessary for the chemistry of life. RNA molecules are especially influenced by divalent metal ions such as Mg\u00b2\u207a, the presence of which not only helps to neutralize the RNA, but creates an overall attractive free energy\u2014an important effect not found under simple monovalent salt conditions. \u2767 Methods of modeling ionic and polyionic systems date back to the early 20th century, when Peter Debye and Erich H\u00fcckel developed their purely analytical, Poisson-Boltzmann formalism of electrolytes that persists as the primary model used for most theoretical applications. However, the Debye-H\u00fcckel model breaks down when considering highly correlated polyions such as nucleic acids, as well as divalent and other high-valence ionic solutions in concentrations similar to those found in vivo. The theoretical limits of the Debye-H\u00fcckel model in tandem with the rise of simulation and numerical methods for studying biological systems has led to a need for alternative models of polyelectrolyte systems that will correctly account for complex ionic conditions while simultaneously allowing for calculations fast enough to be incorporated into simulation. \u2767 In this thesis, we study the interaction between RNA and positive counterions, focusing specifically on divalent cations. We begin with a discussion the structure and function of RNA, and we cover new research showing that RNA has more functionality and biochemically relevant applications than ever previously thought. This is followed by a recap of prior theoretical studies and models of electrolyte and polyelectrolyte systems\u2014both for RNAs specifically as well as general models. We then present our own model for RNA-ion interactions, which allows us to calculate the counterion-mediated free energy of RNA, but only through an NP-complete optimization problem. A heuristic approach to this NP-complete problem is developed, which is shown to work very well for all functional RNAs smaller than the ribosome, and is computationally fast and effective enough to be incorporated into full simulation. Monte Carlo simulations of RNA are run with our implicit divalent ion model incorporated, and we show that our model matches closely with experiment. Most biomolecular simulation is done via molecular dynamics methodology, and to account for this, we further develop our numerical approach so that ensemble forces may be calculated and incorporated into molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we develop a full coarse-grained model of RNA that accurately handles the attractive electrostatic forces generated by the presence of divalent counterions, and use this model to simulate and study RNA 2-way junctions.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-190494", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-190494", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

While friction is certainly a necessary phenomenon, it presents one glaring problem. We need energy to overcome the resistance to motion that is caused by frictional forces, and too much of it causes excess cost, increased energy to perform work and, therefore, increased inefficiencies as well. It is the purpose of this Thesis, then, to present an advance towards two interconnected objectives in this regard. The first is a better understanding of the mechanical and energetic precursors that give rise to friction and, then, to present applicable results in this regard. These objectives are studied in this Thesis, including the tribological properties of silicon carbide, a material commonly used in high-temperature conditions, and the superlubric properties of graphene, an excellent solid lubricant, and its behavior coupled with a series of precious metals. The final chapter will study friction between sandstone surfaces, represented by quartz, one of the most common terrestrial minerals, and its frictional properties at subseismic sliding conditions. \u2767 Sliding friction between two SiC surfaces is important, due to its relevance to many practical applications. It is also important to study whether kinetic friction at the nanoscale follows Coulomb's law. Since SiC exists both as an amorphous material and with a crystalline structure, the effect of surface roughness on the kinetic friction may also be significant. We report the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulation of sliding friction between surfaces of the two types of SiC over a wide range of sliding velocities. The amorphous SiC was generated by the reactive force field ReaxFF, which was also used to represent the interaction potential for the simulation of sliding friction. As the sliding velocity increases, bond breaking occurs at the interface between the two surfaces, leading to their roughening and formation of excess free volume. They reduce the kinetic friction force, hence resulting in decreasing the difference between kinetic friction in the amorphous and crystalline surfaces. The average kinetic friction force depends nonlinearly on the sliding velocity V, implying that Coulomb's law of friction is not satisfied by the surfaces that we study at the nanoscale. The average kinetic friction force F\u2096 depends on V as, F\u2096 \u221d ln V. \u2767 The state of extremely low friction, known as superlubricity, has very important applications to the development of various types of materials, including those that are invaluable to the goal of reducing energy loss in mechanical systems, and those in complex gearing and bearing systems. One material that can produce very low friction is graphene that offers distinct properties as a solid-state lubricant, and can potentially be used as a coating material on surfaces. We have carried out extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to study and compute the friction force between a graphene nanoribbon and an inert metal surface. The metal surfaces that we study are those of Au, Ag, and Pt, all of which are used in various instruments, as well as in various materials employed in the industry. Consistent with very recent experiments, the Au-graphene system exhibits superlubricity, but the Ag-graphene and Pt-graphene pairs manifest friction forces higher than that of Au-graphene, although they are still very small. The MD simulations indicate that the average friction force for graphene on an Au surface is approximately 1.5 pN, with the corresponding values being about 6 pN and 11 pN for, respectively, Ag and Pt surfaces. \u2767 The frictional behavior of faults during seismic events, such as earthquakes, is a topic of profound importance. The experimentally-observed degradation of shear strengths in silicate rocks has been hypothesized to emanate from the phenomenon of \u201cflash heating.\u201d Using extensive MD simulations, we study this phenomenon at interstitial asperities for quartz crystals and present extensive results on the mechanical and thermal evolution of the material under shearing and various sliding velocities. Furthermore, we also present the evolution as a function of varying the thickness of the two layers sliding with respect to each other. We discover that with an increase in the sliding velocity, the frequency and intensity of flash heating events increase as well. This in turn destabilizes the crystalline structure at the interface between opposing quartz layers, forming an amorphous layer. At low slip rates, the heat generated is able to diffuse away appreciably through the material, resulting in a small temperature rise and, therefore, weak effect on the overall strength of the material. At higher slip rates, however, there is not enough time for the heat generated at the interface to dissipate. This in turn causes an increase in the overall interstitial temperature, which in turn causes decreased material strength, followed by sharply reduced frictional resistance.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-143591", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-143591", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Functional deficiency of tyrosinase results in serious dermatological diseases. Tyrosinase also participates in neuromelanin formation in the human brain, which leads to neurodegeneration resulting in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In fruits and vegetables, tyrosinase plays a critical role in senescence, causing undesired browning that results in faster deterioration and shorter shelf lines. The only commercially available tyrosinase is mushroom tyrosinase and it shows the highest homology to the mammalian tyrosinase. Although kojic acid is currently used as a tyrosinase inhibitor, they have serious side effects such as dermatitis, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to develop a more active and safer tyrosinase inhibitor, 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were generated based on experimentally known inhibitors. The pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with a large cost difference, high correlation coefficient and low RMS deviation. Hypo1 showed a good spatial arrangement; consisting of five-point features including two hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond donor and two hydrophobic features. Hypo1 was further validated by cost analysis, test set and Fisher\u2019s randomisation method. Hypo1 was used as a 3D query for screening the in-house drug-like databases, and the hits were further selected by applying ADMET, Lipinski\u2019s rule of five and fit value criteria. To identify binding conformations, the obtained hits were subjected to molecular docking. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the appropriate binding modes of hit compounds.

There has been a resulting development of reconfigurable computers that have microprocessors, reconfigurable hardware, and high-performance interconnect. We address several aspects of accelerating scientific computing applications with reconfigurable hardware and reconfigurable computers.; Because there is no native support on reconfigurable hardware for the floating-point arithmetic needed by many scientific computing applications, we introduce a library of double-precision floating-point cores and analyze the effects on performance of the degree of pipelining and the implemented features of IEEE standard 754. Scientific computing applications may spend a large amount of time evaluating arithmetic expressions. Hence, we present area-efficient designs for arithmetic expression evaluation that hide the pipeline latencies of floating-point cores. These designs use at most two cores for each type of operator in the expression and have better area and throughput properties than designs generated by a state-of-the-art hardware compiler for FPGAs. Experiments show that for 64- and 1024-input expressions, area increases linearly with the number of types of operators.; Implementing a design on a reconfigurable computer can be difficult and is not guaranteed to give a speed-up. We thus formulate hierarchical architectural and performance models for reconfigurable computers that facilitate performance prediction early in the design process. The performance model has errors of 5% to 13% in our work in accelerating molecular dynamics. A hierarchical programming model for developing and modeling implementations of scientific computing applications on reconfigurable computers is also provided.; To demonstrate acceleration of a complete scientific computing application, we study molecular dynamics on reconfigurable computers. We investigate single-node, shifted-force simulations; single-node, particle-mesh-Ewald simulations; and multinode, shifted-force simulations. We attain 2x to 3x speed-ups over state-of-the-art microprocessors through a hardware/software approach in which the most intensive task executes on reconfigurable hardware and the rest of the tasks execute on the microprocessor.

The deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 21A2), an enzyme involved in cortisol synthesis, is responsible for \u223c95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This metabolic disease exhibits three clinical forms: salt-wasting, simple virilizing, and non-classical form, which are divided according to the degree of severity. In the present study, structural and mutational analyses were performed in order to identify the structural impact of mutations on cytochrome P450 21A2 and correlate them with patient clinical severity. The following mutations were selected: arginine-356 to tryptophan (R356W), proline-30 to leucine (P30L), isoleucine-172 to asparagine (I172N), valine-281 to leucine (V281L), and the null mutation glutamine-318 (Q318X). Our computational approach mapped the location of residues on P450 and identified their implications on enzyme electrostatic potential mapping to progesterone and heme binding pockets. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the structural stability of ligand binding and protein structure, as well as possible conformational changes at the catalytic pocket that leads to impairment of enzymatic activity.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of these complexes were carried out to rationalize the ligand interaction. The validated model was then used for molecular docking studies of small-molecule inhibitors. The results derived from MD simulations of the complex between DV NS2B/NS3 protease and the tetra-peptidic inhibitor as well as with small-molecule inhibitors revealed that residues at the C-terminus of NS2B (Asp81-Ser85), at the S1 pocket (Leu128-Thr134 of NS3), His51, Asp75, Ser135, Gly151, Asn152, Gly153 and Tyr161 of NS3 are important for inhibitor interaction. Results also demonstrated that NS2B is important for stabilizing the binding pocket of NS3 as well as for stabilzing the binding of the tetra-peptidic inhibitor. A stepwise virtual screening (VS) for DV NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors was carried out by combining pharmacophore and molecular docking-based screening with subsequent binding free energy calculation. Hit compounds were selected from commercial compound libraries and proposed for biological testing using the DV NS2B/NS3 protease. In the second part, a 3D-QSAR model using the CoMFA approach was constructed for pyrrolocarbazole derivatives reported as Wee1 kinase inhibitors. The derived model was found to be robust and predictive, indicated by good statistical values (r2 = 0.870, q2LOO = 0.764 and r2pred. = 0.790). The analysis of the graphical CoMFA contour plot provided insight into the relevant interactions of the inhibitors and the essential features of potent Wee1 kinase inhibitors. Subsequently, a structure-based approach was developed to predict the binding activities of Wee1 kinase inhibitors. Linear interaction energy models for pyrrolocarbazole and pyridopyrimidine derivative were established. The obtained models yielded a good correlation between the experimental binding affinities and the calculated binding free energies. A carried out enrichment study showed that most of the true active compounds could be obtained by screening only the first 10% of compound databases containing actives and decoys.

The same NPs were also found to insert into a series of model cell membranes as a precursor to cellular uptake, but the insertion mechanism remains unclear. Previous simulations have demonstrated that an amphiphilic NP can insert into a single leaflet of a planar lipid bilayer, but in this configuration all charged end groups are localized to one side of the bilayer and it is unknown if further insertion is thermodynamically favorable. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to show that an amphiphilic NP can reach the bilayer midplane non-disruptively if charged ligands iteratively ``flip'' across the bilayer. Ligand flipping is a favorable process that relaxes bilayer curvature, decreases the nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area of the NP monolayer, and increases attractive ligand-lipid electrostatic interactions. Analysis of end group hydration further indicates that iterative ligand flipping can occur on experimentally relevant timescales. Supported by these results, we present a complete energy landscape for the non-disruptive insertion of amphiphilic NPs into lipid bilayers. These findings will help guide the design of NPs to enhance bilayer insertion and non-endocytic cellular uptake, and also provide physical insight into a possible pathway for the translocation of charged biomacromolecules.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.3r0h560", "publicationDate": "2019-01-10", "dateAvailable": "2019-01-10", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3r0h560", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 21A2), an enzyme involved in cortisol synthesis, is responsible for \u223c95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This metabolic disease exhibits three clinical forms: salt-wasting, simple virilizing, and non-classical form, which are divided according to the degree of severity. In the present study, structural and mutational analyses were performed in order to identify the structural impact of mutations on cytochrome P450 21A2 and correlate them with patient clinical severity. The following mutations were selected: arginine-356 to tryptophan (R356W), proline-30 to leucine (P30L), isoleucine-172 to asparagine (I172N), valine-281 to leucine (V281L), and the null mutation glutamine-318 (Q318X). Our computational approach mapped the location of residues on P450 and identified their implications on enzyme electrostatic potential mapping to progesterone and heme binding pockets. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the structural stability of ligand binding and protein structure, as well as possible conformational changes at the catalytic pocket that leads to impairment of enzymatic activity.

Results are presented for gas/liquid, liquid/solid and gas/solid coexistence curves, the Joule-Thomson inversion curve, and several other thermodynamic properties.

The coexistence densities, saturation pressure, and supercritical isotherms of the LJ spline model were fairly well represented by the Peng-Robison equation of state. We find that Barker-Henderson perturbation theory works less good for the LJ spline than for the LJ model. The first-order perturbation theory overestimates the critical temperature and pressure by about 10% and 90%, respectively. A second-order perturbation theory is not much better. Our assessment is that the mean compressibility approximation gives a poor representation of the second-order perturbation term.

Commonly, interatomic potentials are designed using functional forms driven by physical intuition and fitted to experimental or computational data. The moderate flexibility of these functional forms limits their ability to be systematically improved by increasing the fitting datasets; on the other hand, their qualitative description of the essential physical interactions ensures a modicum degree of transferability. Recently, a novel trend has emerged where potential-energy surfaces are represented by neural networks fitted on large numbers of first-principles calculations, thus maximizing flexibility but requiring extensive datasets to ensure transferability. Gaussian Approximation Potentials in particular are a novel class of potentials based on non-linear, non-parametric Gaussian-process regression.

Functional deficiency of tyrosinase results in serious dermatological diseases. Tyrosinase also participates in neuromelanin formation in the human brain, which leads to neurodegeneration resulting in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In fruits and vegetables, tyrosinase plays a critical role in senescence, causing undesired browning that results in faster deterioration and shorter shelf lines. The only commercially available tyrosinase is mushroom tyrosinase and it shows the highest homology to the mammalian tyrosinase. Although kojic acid is currently used as a tyrosinase inhibitor, they have serious side effects such as dermatitis, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to develop a more active and safer tyrosinase inhibitor, 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were generated based on experimentally known inhibitors. The pharmacophore model, Hypo1, was developed with a large cost difference, high correlation coefficient and low RMS deviation. Hypo1 showed a good spatial arrangement; consisting of five-point features including two hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond donor and two hydrophobic features. Hypo1 was further validated by cost analysis, test set and Fisher\u2019s randomisation method. Hypo1 was used as a 3D query for screening the in-house drug-like databases, and the hits were further selected by applying ADMET, Lipinski\u2019s rule of five and fit value criteria. To identify binding conformations, the obtained hits were subjected to molecular docking. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the appropriate binding modes of hit compounds. To conclude, we propose the final three hit compounds with new structural scaffolds as a virtual candidate as tyrosinase inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Mutations in the gene of WNK family, especially in WNK1 and WNK4 are responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), characterized by hypertension. The selective inhibition of WNK1 over other isoforms has created an immense challenge in the design of an ATP competitive inhibitor due to their high conservatism. In this work, we have compared the selectivity of the inhibitor WNK463, which was designed for WNK1 with other WNK family isoforms by comprehensive molecular modeling, docking and molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method. Our calculations show that the affinity of the inhibitor decreases in the order WNK2 &gt; WNK1 &gt; WNK3 &gt; WNK4, in agreement with the experiment. Our study reveals that the inhibitor is most selective to WNK2 due to decreased polar solvation and configurational entropy compared to other isoforms. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the nonpolar contribution from the hydrophobic residues and hydrogen bonds in the hinge region gatekeeper residue Met304 of WNK1 and its equivalent residue from other kinases played a critical role in stabilizing the inhibitor against WNK kinases. Residues Lys233, Met304, Phe356 and Leu369 of WNK1 were the essential residue differences compared to other isoforms that led to specific interactions thereby forming the basis of molecular binding pattern of binding interactions. Overall, we have identified conserved WNK-inhibitor interactions and elucidated isoform-specific interactions that could be exploited in the design of more potent and selective WNK inhibitors.

One approach is designed to inhibit entry of HIV into host cells, with a target being the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Polyanionic compounds have been shown to be effective in inhibiting HIV entry, with a mechanism involving electrostatic interactions with the V3 loop of gp120 being proposed. In this study, we applied computational methods to elucidate molecular interactions between the repeat unit of the precisely alternating polyanion, Poly(4,4\u2032-stilbenedicarboxylate-alt\u2013maleic acid) (DCSti-alt-MA) and the V3 loop of gp120 from strains of HIV against which these polyanions were previously tested (IIIb, BaL, 92UG037, JR-CSF) as well as two strains for which gp120 crystal structures are available (YU2, 2B4C). Homology modeling was used to create models of the gp120 proteins. Using monomers of the gp120 protein, we applied extensive molecular dynamics simulations to obtain dominant morphologies that represent a variety of open-closed states of the V3 loop to examine the interaction of 112 ligands of the repeating units of DCSti-alt-MA docked to the V3 loop and surrounding residues. Using the distance between the V1/V2 and V3 loops of gp120 as a metric, we revealed through MD simulations that gp120 from the lab-adapted strains (BaL and IIIb), which are more susceptible to inhibition by DCSti-alt-MA, clearly transitioned to the closed state in one replicate of each simulation set, whereas none of the replicates from the Tier II strains (92UG037 and JR-CSF) did so. Docking repeat unit microspecies to the gp120 protein before and after MD simulation enabled identification of residues that were key for binding. Notably, only a few residues were found to be important for docking both before and after MD simulation as a result of the conformational heterogeneity provided by the simulations. Consideration of the residues that were consistently involved in interactions with the ligand revealed the importance of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties of the ligand for effective binding. The results also suggest that polymers of DCSti-alt-MA with repeating units of different configurations may have advantages for therapeutic efficacy.", "doi": "10.7294/w49s1p7v", "publicationDate": "2017-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.7294%2Fw49s1p7v", "method": null, "source": "viva.vt", "type_cont": null},

The deficiency of steroid 21-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 21A2), an enzyme involved in cortisol synthesis, is responsible for \u223c95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This metabolic disease exhibits three clinical forms: salt-wasting, simple virilizing, and non-classical form, which are divided according to the degree of severity. In the present study, structural and mutational analyses were performed in order to identify the structural impact of mutations on cytochrome P450 21A2 and correlate them with patient clinical severity. The following mutations were selected: arginine-356 to tryptophan (R356W), proline-30 to leucine (P30L), isoleucine-172 to asparagine (I172N), valine-281 to leucine (V281L), and the null mutation glutamine-318 (Q318X). Our computational approach mapped the location of residues on P450 and identified their implications on enzyme electrostatic potential mapping to progesterone and heme binding pockets. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the structural stability of ligand binding and protein structure, as well as possible conformational changes at the catalytic pocket that leads to impairment of enzymatic activity.

As suggested by the calculations, the drug-graphene bindings were mainly governed by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. The loading capacity of gemcitabine drug inside single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) cavity was subsequently studied by molecular dynamics (MD). The results showed that more than one anti-cancer drug can be encapsulated inside the tube cavity through the partial \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the aromatic cytosine ring of gemcitabine and the inner surface of the SWCNT together with the interactions among gemcitabine molecules themselves. Then, the effect of the length of chitosan (CS), an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-SWCNT linker, has been explored by replica exchange MD simulation. The appropriate chitosan length with a minimum mass ratio of chitosan per SWCNT of 1.26 can preserve EGF conformation and prevent the steric effect from SWCNT towards binding interface of EGF and its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Importantly, the EGF of EGF-CS-SWCNT had similar binding affinity with EGFR respect to the EGF alone as indicated from MD results.

Mutations in the gene of WNK family, especially in WNK1 and WNK4 are responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), characterized by hypertension. The selective inhibition of WNK1 over other isoforms has created an immense challenge in the design of an ATP competitive inhibitor due to their high conservatism. In this work, we have compared the selectivity of the inhibitor WNK463, which was designed for WNK1 with other WNK family isoforms by comprehensive molecular modeling, docking and molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method. Our calculations show that the affinity of the inhibitor decreases in the order WNK2 &gt; WNK1 &gt; WNK3 &gt; WNK4, in agreement with the experiment. Our study reveals that the inhibitor is most selective to WNK2 due to decreased polar solvation and configurational entropy compared to other isoforms. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the nonpolar contribution from the hydrophobic residues and hydrogen bonds in the hinge region gatekeeper residue Met304 of WNK1 and its equivalent residue from other kinases played a critical role in stabilizing the inhibitor against WNK kinases. Residues Lys233, Met304, Phe356 and Leu369 of WNK1 were the essential residue differences compared to other isoforms that led to specific interactions thereby forming the basis of molecular binding pattern of binding interactions.

The interaction between the coarse-grained water molecules (explicit solvent molecules) is modeled as a Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. To demonstrate that the proposed methods do capture the observed dynamics of vesicles and RBCs, we focus on two sets of LAMMPS simulations: 1. Vesicle shape transitions with enclosed volume; 2.

Molecular interactions mediate structural changes in proteins and their complexes, which modulate their activities, and      regulate complex processes, including cellular transport of components across membranes, gene expression, and genome replication. Gaining knowledge of these systems requires experimental techniques that     span the temporal and spatial scales of the environment, ranging from the atomic description of the individual components to knowledge about the detailed locations of all of its components at the cell        level. The cellular environment is complex, teeming with thousands of molecular structures in a dynamic equilibrium. \u2767 Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) is an emerging technology which provides some unique advantages in the study of structural organization of entire cells. The samples are lightly processed in a close to native state, essentially providing a snapshot of the interior composition of cells. In principle, samples used in cryoET provide information about the spatial organization of the cell, allowing researchers to detect the structures of objects the size of protein complexes, as well as their relative orientation, abundance, and interactions. With a dynamic environment, these values provide insight into the functionality of a cell's components. However, extracting this information is challenging due to the relatively low resolution, low signal-to-noise ratio, and distortions in the tomograms due to missing data. \u2767 Cryo-ET provides a 3-dimensional density of the volume under study. Segmentation of the volume based on regions of high density allows the identification of individual protein complexes, as well as larger structures. These can be compared to known structures, or against each other to classify them into groups whose density maps can be averaged to increase their resolution. This large scale analysis is computationally intensive, demanding expansive resources. Here we describe the TomoMiner package, a parallel computing framework for these calculations. The software runs on computer clusters with hundreds of processors and can handle the alignment, clustering, and averaging of hundreds of thousands of subtomograms. After recovering detailed data regarding the interior of cells, one approach to understanding  the dynamics of the system is modeling the reaction-diffusion behavior of all its components. At the scale of entire cells containing an abundance of protein complexes, atomic modeling is too detailed and would require too many steps in order to model large scale processes.Brownian dynamics (BD) allows the abstraction of the smallest molecules in the simulation, and allows for the simulation of larger temporal steps than molecular dynamics.  Brownian dynamics simulations still have restrictions based on reaction and diffusion rates, which limit the scope of the time steps available in the simulations. We have developed an approach to accelerate Brownian dynamics simulations specifically tailored for simulating the reaction-diffusion process of crowded mixtures of proteins. The approach removes constraints due to fast reaction rates that require small temporal steps for diffusion limited reactions. The only remaining constraints on BD simulations are those required by physical constraints and limitations. The new algorithm for BD simulations accurately reproduce reactions and dynamics of cellular scale systems with temporal step increases over existing approaches, allowing for simulations at cellular time scales. These two contributions, a package for discovering features at the cellular scale of real environments, and the ability to accurately simulate the environment more efficiently, provide researchers with techniques for accelerated discovery at the cellular scale.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-198976", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-198976", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Many biophysical methods have been used to determine structures of RNA and DNA, including X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. However, it is difficult to use these methods for complex folds. Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using the double electron electron resonance (DEER) sequence can be used also to measure distances between spin labels at two positions in nucleic acids, and this method offers an alternative approach to structure determination. However, conversion of DEER data into structures requires a computational approach. Prior to the work described in this thesis, an in-house algorithm, NASNOX, was available for addition of spin labels to DNA and RNA and calculation of inter-label distances for known structures. The goal of the work in the thesis was to develop and test new algorithms for prediction of structure based on DEER data, using inter-label distances calculated with NASNOX and other constraints.; In the first algorithm (JUNFOLD), point representations of spin-label distributions and translations and rotations of helical axes are used to produce simplified models of spin-labeled junction conformations that can be compared with experimental data. Simple RNA and DNA junctions were tested using 'experimental' data calculated with NASNOX, and good RMSD values were obtained for the predicted structures. This algorithm was then used for prediction of the structure of the packaging RNA (pRNA) dimer based on experimental DEER data. The derived structure fitted well with inter-label distances and biochemical data.; Despite the successful use of JUNFOLD, the long running time was a concern. Therefore, another algorithm (JUNFOLD-M) was developed based on solving a complex system of algebraic equations corresponding to inter-label distances using a quasi-Newton method, in which solutions represent the coordinates of the average points. This approach produced results similar to those of JUNFOLD, but with a running time that was 10 to 100 times faster.; The effect of backbone and sequence on inter-label distances and label behavior was examined in two ways. First, a library of inter-label distances and structural geometries were derived for DNA and RNA helices. These data can be used to determine the helix conformation based on inter-label distances. Second, molecular dynamics simulations were performed for DNA duplexes to obtain structural information on the labeled site, correlate this information with experimental EPR findings, and determine the effect of sequence, label diastereoisomer, and type of label on the EPR spectrum. These studies provide information that can be reduced into a simple empirical model for calculation of inter-label distances in NASNOX.; The ideas developed for DNA and RNA in the NASNOX, JUNFOLD and JUNFOLD-M algorithms are also applicable to protein structure. An algorithm, PRONOX, was developed for addition of labels at specific sites of a protein and calculation of inter-label distances (this algorithm is equivalent to NASNOX). PRONOX calculations for 44 DEER distances determined for 5 proteins gave a high correlation coefficient between the theoretical and experimental data, and PRONOX was implemented in JUNFOLD for use in protein structure determination.; The algorithms developed in this thesis provide a package of routines for conversion of DEER data into biomolecular structure. With further modification, they will also permit inclusion of other experimental data, and should be of importance in future determination of RNA and DNA folds and protein conformation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3666", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3666", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Several computational studies have been performed to investigate conformational and dynamical properties of TCRs for enhanced immunogenicity. Here, we present the large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the two comprehensive systems consisting of the wild-type and mutant IG4 TCR in complex with the tumor epitope NY-ESO peptide (SLLMWITQC) and analyzed for mapping conformational changes of TCR in the states prior to antigen binding, upon antigen binding and after the antigen was released. All of the simulations were performed with different states of TCRs for each 1000 ns of simulation time, providing six simulations for time duration of 6000 ns (6\u00b5s). We show that rather than undergoing most critical conformational changes upon antigen binding, the high proportion of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops change by comparatively small amount. The hypervariable CDR\u03b13 and CDR\u03b23 loops showed significant structural changes. Interestingly, the TCR \u03b2 chain loops showed the least changes, which is reliable with recent implications that \u03b2 domain of TCR may propel antigen interaction. The mutant shows higher rigidity than wild-type even in released state; expose an induced fit mechanism occurring from the re-structuring of CDR\u03b13 loop and can allow enhanced binding affinity of the peptide antigen. Additionally, we show that CDR\u03b13 loop and peptide contacts are an adaptive feature of affinity enhanced mutant TCR. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this work, quantitative and qualitative methods for the description of the electronic spectroscopy of open-shell species in the gas and condensed phases are developed.; Dimer radical cations are important model systems for studying ionization and charge transfer processes. Achieving a reliable theoretical description for these systems is difficult due to the symmetry-breaking of the open-shell Hartree-Fock reference and near-degeneracies. The equation-of-motion coupled-cluster for ionization potentials (EOM-IP-CC) method implemented and benchmarked here remedies these problems by using the corresponding closed-shell reference. It is combined with a qualitative Dimer Molecular Orbitals -- Linear Combination of Fragment Molecular Orbitals (DMOLCFMO) framework to elucidate the electronic states of benzene dimer and water dimer cations. In the former case the geometry of the ground state changes from a T-shaped neutral to a displaced sandwich cation. Charge resonance bands, whose spectral location and intensity are sensitive to the geometry of the system, are present in both isomers. A reordering of electronic states in the local excitation region in the sandwich structure is observed. For the water dimer vertical ionization occurs from the hydrogen-bond donor and induces a proton transfer reaction. The evolution of the electronic spectroscopy along the reaction coordinate is studied. The initial spectrum consists of mixed local and charge-transfer excitations, while the spectrum of the final product resembles that of the hydroxyl radical product. An empirical correction to the density functional theory (DFT) approach used in larger condensed phase Car-Parrinello simulations is benchmarked.; A fully condensed phase treatment is applied for the cyano radical in water. Conflicting assignments appeared in the literature as to the position of the absorption band of aqueous CN. Classical molecular dynamics simulations are combined with accurate ab initio calculations to unravel the effect of water on the two lowest electronic states of cyano radical. Accurate dimer calculations are used to parametrize the force field.

It is the epicenter of cellular function, and, given its complicated composition, even minute alterations in its structure can prompt extensive consequences. Understanding the dynamics of the plasma membrane can, therefore, provide a powerful glimpse into how life works and how it can be influenced. This dissertation details the development and application of new tools created to further our understanding of the structure and function of the plasma membrane. These tools are based on pulsed power, nonlinear optics, scientific computing, and data visualization. \u2767 The primary means for asking questions of this membrane will be brief (~ns) but intense (MV/m) electric pulses termed nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs). Pulsed power, like nsPEFs, is a valuable biomedical tool that is capable of controllably disrupting the membrane, making it an ideal means of testing new methodologies and techniques. Using multimodal probes and the specialized selection criteria of second harmonic generation (SHG), the development, both theoretical and practical, of a new methodology for measuring localized membrane disruption is presented. Once established, this new methodology is applied to investigate the effect of novel stimuli on the cell membrane. One such stimulus is bipolar nsPEFs, which are used to understand the role of membrane charging on nanopore development. Another stimulus of interest is infrared (IR) pulses, which we apply to primary neurons in order to conduct a mechanistic comparison of optical and electrical neural stimulation. \u2767 Finally, the closing chapters of this dissertation outline efforts to develop an immersive data visualization framework capable of applying scientific computing to components of the membrane. While this framework is not limited to studies of the membrane, for the purposes of this dissertation, it provides a well-defined roadmap for further experimentation. For example, the software framework allows for dynamic simulation and visualization of nonequilibrium phase transitions in biological electron transport pathways, pivotal for cellular respiration. The workflow is unique, though, in that it can be generalized to examine and test any kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) process on a general graph in virtual reality (VR).

We have combined molecular dynamics simulations of the ErbB kinases with the protein structure network modeling to characterize the reorganization of the residue interaction networks during conformational equilibrium changes in the normal and oncogenic forms. Structural stability and network analyses have identified local communities integrated around high centrality sites that correspond to the regulatory spine residues. This analysis has provided a quantitative insight to the mechanism of mutation-induced \u201csuperacceptor\u201d activity in oncogenic EGFR dimers. We have found that kinase activation may be determined by allosteric interactions between modules of structurally stable residues that synchronize the dynamics in the nucleotide binding site and the \u03b1C-helix with the collective motions of the integrating \u03b1F-helix and the substrate binding site. The results of this study have pointed to a central role of the conserved His-Arg-Asp (HRD) motif in the catalytic loop and the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif as key mediators of structural stability and allosteric communications in the ErbB kinases. We have determined that residues that are indispensable for kinase regulation and catalysis often corresponded to the high centrality nodes within the protein structure network and could be distinguished by their unique network signatures. The optimal communication pathways are also controlled by these nodes and may ensure efficient allosteric signaling in the functional kinase state. Structure-based network analysis has quantified subtle effects of ATP binding on conformational dynamics and stability of the EGFR structures. Consistent with the NMR studies, we have found that nucleotide-induced modulation of the residue interaction networks is not limited to the ATP site, and may enhance allosteric cooperativity with the substrate binding region by increasing communication capabilities of mediating residues.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.qj597", "publicationDate": "2014-12-03", "dateAvailable": "2014-12-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qj597", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The fatal influenza A/H7N9 has drawn attention since the first wave of infections in March 2013 and raised more grave concerns with its increased potential to spread among humans. Experimental studies have revealed several hosts and virulence markers, indicating differential host binding preferences which can help estimate the potential of causing a pandemic. Here we systematically investigate the sequence pattern and structural characteristics of novel influenza A/H7N9 using computational approaches.  RESULTS: The sequence analysis highlighted mutations in protein functional domains of influenza viruses. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) of A/Taiwan/1/2017(H7N9) strain enhanced the binding with both avian and human receptor analogs, compared with the previous A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9) strain. The Molecular Mechanics - Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculation revealed the change of residue-ligand interaction energy and detected the residues with conspicuous binding preference.  CONCLUSION: The results are novel and specific to the emerging influenza A/Taiwan/1/2017(H7N9) strain compared with A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9).

Several computational studies have been performed to investigate conformational and dynamical properties of TCRs for enhanced immunogenicity. Here, we present the large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the two comprehensive systems consisting of the wild-type and mutant IG4 TCR in complex with the tumor epitope NY-ESO peptide (SLLMWITQC) and analyzed for mapping conformational changes of TCR in the states prior to antigen binding, upon antigen binding and after the antigen was released. All of the simulations were performed with different states of TCRs for each 1000 ns of simulation time, providing six simulations for time duration of 6000 ns (6\u00b5s). We show that rather than undergoing most critical conformational changes upon antigen binding, the high proportion of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops change by comparatively small amount. The hypervariable CDR\u03b13 and CDR\u03b23 loops showed significant structural changes. Interestingly, the TCR \u03b2 chain loops showed the least changes, which is reliable with recent implications that \u03b2 domain of TCR may propel antigen interaction. The mutant shows higher rigidity than wild-type even in released state; expose an induced fit mechanism occurring from the re-structuring of CDR\u03b13 loop and can allow enhanced binding affinity of the peptide antigen. Additionally, we show that CDR\u03b13 loop and peptide contacts are an adaptive feature of affinity enhanced mutant TCR. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions, capable of transferring infectious items among individuals, to build transmission networks of diffusion. However, delayed indirect interactions, where a susceptible individual interacts with infectious items after the infected individual has left the interaction space, can also cause transmission events. We define a diffusion model called the same place different time transmission (SPDT) based diffusion that considers transmission links for these indirect interactions. Our SPDT model changes the network dynamics where the connectivity among individuals varies with the decay rates of link infectivity. We investigate SPDT diffusion behaviours by simulating airborne disease spreading on data-driven contact networks. The SPDT model significantly increases diffusion dynamics with a high rate of disease transmission. By making the underlying connectivity denser and stronger due to the inclusion of indirect transmissions, SPDT models are more realistic than SPST models for the study of various airborne diseases outbreaks. Importantly, we also find that the diffusion dynamics including indirect links are not reproducible by the current SPST models based on direct links, even if both SPDT and SPST networks assume the same underlying connectivity.

Here we investigated the migratory orientation of juvenile lesser spotted eagles (LSE) (Clanga pomarina) based on translocation and satellite tracking. Between 2004 and 2016, 85 second-hatched juveniles (Abels) were reared in captivity for release into the declining German population, including 50 birds that were translocated 940 km from Latvia. In 2009, we tracked 12 translocated juveniles, as well as 8 native juveniles and 9 native adults, to determine how inexperienced birds come to use strategic migration routes. Native juveniles departed around the same time as the adults and 6 of 8 used the eastern flyway around the Mediterranean, which was used by all adults. In contrast, translocated juveniles departed on average 6 days before native LSEs, and 5 traveled southward and died in the central Mediterranean region. Consequently fewer translocated juveniles (4/12) than native juveniles (7/8) reached Africa. We conclude that juvenile LSEs have a much better chance of learning the strategic southeastern flyway if they leave at an appropriate time to connect with experienced elders upon departure. It is not clear why translocated juveniles departed so early. Regardless, by the end of the year, most juveniles had perished, whether they were translocated (10/12) or not (6/8). The small number of surviving translocated juveniles thus still represents a significant increase in the annual productivity of the German LSE population in 2009.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.82j26", "publicationDate": "2017-05-10", "dateAvailable": "2017-05-10", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.82j26", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The modification of aminoglycoside antibiotics by enzymes such as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases is the predominant mechanism of resistance to antibiotics in bacterial system. In the present study, we identified and characterized LdATLP (an acetyltransferase-like protein) and elucidated its role in paromomycin resistance in Leishmania donovani. Gene encoding LdATLP was consistently up-regulated (&gt;2fold) in three distinct paromomycin resistant in comparison with sensitive parasites, although the gene sequence was identical in the two. In silico analysis revealed that LdATLP consisted of conserved GNAT (GCN5-related N-Acetyltransferase) domain which is characteristic of aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases. Evolutionary relationship among LdATLP of Leishmania and aminoglycoside acetyltransferases of bacteria was established by phylogenetic analysis. The 3D structure of LdATLP, predicted by ab-initio modeling, constituted 6 \u03b1-helices and 6 \u03b2-sheets. A few residues, such as R175, R177, E196, R197, V198, V200, K202, R205, C206, D208, G210, R211, R215, A234, S237, S238, K239, D240, F241 and Y242 of GNAT domain were predicted to be present at active site. Molecular docking of LdATLP with paromomycin or indolicidin (broad spectrum inhibitor of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes), followed by molecular dynamics simulation of docked complex suggested that both paromomycin and indolicidin bind to LdATLP with comparable free energy of binding. In vitro studies revealed that in the presence of indolicidin, paromomycin resistant parasites exhibited reversion of phenotype into sensitive parasites with marked increase in paromomycin susceptibility, suggesting the role of LdATLP in paromomycin resistance.

Therefore, the search for life beyond our planet hinges on the understanding of planetary ice and its interactions with bio\u2010precursors that could preserve indications of pre\u2010existent life or currently capable of sustaining ecosystems suitable for life by providing nutrients in the form of chemical energy. \u2767 The dissertation manuscript investigates the electrical properties of ice using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and atomistic simulations in an effort to develop an unambiguous instrumentation platform for in\u2010situ planetary exploration.  The experimental portion of the work emphasized the electrical properties behavior of ices doped with ion in order to characterize unique the signatures from detectable from EIS measurements on different ionic species.  To further delve into the transport properties of pure and ion doped ices at the molecular level, molecular dynamics simulations were also performed on KCl\u2010doped ice under various temperature conditions and over a long simulation time of greater than 1 \u03bc-sec.   The systems of atomistic simulations on ice included the addition of the electric field to mimic actual experimental conditions. \u2767 The experiment process also included the development of a unique electrode configuration suitable for long\u2010life field applications.  Measurement results on pure ice using this novel electrode configuration are in excellent agreement with measurements from baseline parallel plate electrodes.  Resonance is also detected with the new configuration at the onset of the Debye relaxation which is unique to our measurement results.  A database of ice measurements resulted in a substantial collection of ice electrical properties parameters suitable for ice characterization based on ionic species and concentration. \u2767 From simulations on pure and KCl\u2010doped ices, structural and transport dynamics was characterized using RDF, MSD, and displacement profiles.  In addition, the physical properties (e.g., density and heat capacity) of ice calculated from simulation are in agreement with actual ice indicating good simulation behavior and provide further validation of results.  Comparison of the electrical properties from the simulations and the experiments indicated excellent agreement as well.  Though many new finding were made regarding the dynamic behavior of ice, the core discovery from simulation is the motions of ions across adjacent ice cavities due to erratic jumps which enhance the observed transport properties.  Such jump events were also substantiated by trajectory plots over the entire simulation time.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-427615", "publicationDate": "2014-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-427615", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Orb2 has two isoforms, Orb2A and Orb2B, and their interaction to form functional amyloids is hypothesized to be a key step in the memory formation process. Huntingtin is a protein that can form pathological amyloids and cause Huntington\u2019s disease when mutated. It also has critical functional roles in normal neural development when not mutated. \u2767 In this thesis, I present a series of experiments on Orb2, with goal of understanding the amyloid structure and how it relates to Orb2\u2019s biological role. I show that Orb2 is capable of forming protein droplets and two different types of fibrils (one of which seems to be derived from droplets). I also show that fibrils formed by Orb2A and Orb2B are highly similar and that within a single monomer in a fibril, residues range in dynamics from extremely static to almost liquid-like. I also present a series of molecular dynamics simulations of a domain of Huntingtin. I show that these simulations can reproduce EPR and NMR data gathered on Huntingtin fibrils, and also help to identify what appears to be a highly conserved protein-protein interaction site in the domain. \u2767 Because this thesis covers a range of experiments on different proteins from different sources, I first present an introduction providing a general background for all topics and methods discussed (CHAPTER 1.

Several thermodynamic and transport properties have been obtained using Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations.

Although timing is a critical adaptive feature of diapause, how environmental cues are integrated with genetically-determined physiological mechanisms to time diapause development, particularly termination, is not well understood. In a design that subjected western North American monarchs to different environmental chamber conditions over time, we modularized constituent components of an environmentally-controlled, internal diapause termination timer. Using comparative transcriptomics, we identified molecular controllers of these specific diapause termination components. Calcium signaling mediated environmental sensitivity of the diapause timer, and we speculate that it is a key integrator of environmental condition (cold temperature) with downstream hormonal control of diapause. Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling changed spontaneously in diapause-inducing conditions, capacitating response to future environmental condition. Although JH is a major target of the internal timer, it is not itself the timer. Epigenetic mechanisms are implicated to be the proximate timing mechanism. Ecdysteroid, JH, and insulin/insulin-like peptide (IIS) signaling are major targets of the diapause program used to control response to permissive environmental conditions. Understanding the environmental and physiological mechanisms of diapause termination sheds light on fundamental properties of biological timing, and also helps inform expectations for how monarch populations may respond to future climate change.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.fd517kq", "publicationDate": "2019-08-15", "dateAvailable": "2019-08-15", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fd517kq", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The modification of aminoglycoside antibiotics by enzymes such as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases is the predominant mechanism of resistance to antibiotics in bacterial system. In the present study, we identified and characterized LdATLP (an acetyltransferase-like protein) and elucidated its role in paromomycin resistance in Leishmania donovani. Gene encoding LdATLP was consistently up-regulated (&gt;2fold) in three distinct paromomycin resistant in comparison with sensitive parasites, although the gene sequence was identical in the two. In silico analysis revealed that LdATLP consisted of conserved GNAT (GCN5-related N-Acetyltransferase) domain which is characteristic of aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases. Evolutionary relationship among LdATLP of Leishmania and aminoglycoside acetyltransferases of bacteria was established by phylogenetic analysis. The 3D structure of LdATLP, predicted by ab-initio modeling, constituted 6 \u03b1-helices and 6 \u03b2-sheets. A few residues, such as R175, R177, E196, R197, V198, V200, K202, R205, C206, D208, G210, R211, R215, A234, S237, S238, K239, D240, F241 and Y242 of GNAT domain were predicted to be present at active site. Molecular docking of LdATLP with paromomycin or indolicidin (broad spectrum inhibitor of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes), followed by molecular dynamics simulation of docked complex suggested that both paromomycin and indolicidin bind to LdATLP with comparable free energy of binding. In vitro studies revealed that in the presence of indolicidin, paromomycin resistant parasites exhibited reversion of phenotype into sensitive parasites with marked increase in paromomycin susceptibility, suggesting the role of LdATLP in paromomycin resistance.

They are widely applied in food products to enhance the health function as well as used in developing nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products. A limiting factor hampering the use of flavonoids in many applications is its low water solubility and stability. In the present study, the inclusion complex with \u03b2-cyclodextrin and dimethyl derivative to solve this problem is our aim. Molecular behaviours of inclusion complex between hesperetin or naringenin and \u03b2-CD/DM-\u03b2-CD, were theoretically investigated using the molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Both hesperetin and naringenin most likely preferred to bind with CDs cavity via the phenyl ring with a formation of strong hydrogen bonds. The system stability and solubility of the two flavanones in complex with DM-\u03b2-CD was considerably more stable and soluble than that with \u03b2-CD. To support these results, we examined the phase solubility diagram of the two flavanones inclusion complexes. The result showed the formation of soluble complex as AL type, indicating increase in flavanone stability when cyclodextrin was increased, with higher solubility of the DM-\u03b2-CD complexes. Solid complexes were prepared and DSC and FTIR were used to confirm the inclusion complex. From the DSC profile, the endothermic peak of free hesperetin and naringenin in the 1:1 inclusion complex formed by freeze-drying method disappeared, with the appearance of a new endothermic peak. This implied that the real inclusion complex was formed while the kneading method did not result in the formation of inclusion complex. Moreover, we examined the release of flavanones from the inclusion complexes compared to the free flavanones by dissolution method. It is clearly seen that the complexation with DM-\u03b2-CD made better release of both flavanones to the aqueous solution than with \u03b2-CD complexes.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2013.1385", "publicationDate": "2013-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2013.1385", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

The detrimental effect of non-synonymous mutations of HMGB1 has not been investigated yet, hence the present study aims to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms and their implications on the structure-function of human HMGB1. The multifaceted HMGB1 protein acts as pleiotropic cytokine and regulates essential genes for coordinated cellular functions. The mutational effect on HMGB1 was analyzed by sequence-based homology methods, supervised learning methods, and structure-based methods. The study identified 58 non-synonymous mutations in human HMGB1, out of which only 2 mutations; R10T (rs61742222) and F103C (rs61733675) were classified as the SNPs with highest deleterious and disease-causing mutants. The effect of these mutations in structure of HMGB1 was scrutinized and the R10T mutant found to have a distinct structural behaviour in the B-box domain. In addition, R10T mutant predicted that it affects the MoRF function of HMGB1 and it could disrupt the DNA binding or/and protein partner interaction activity by HMGB1. F103C mutation takes place at the TLR binding and cytokine inducing region of HMGB1, hence it could affect the protein binding activity which involves in many cellular signaling. The study identified potent mutations R10T (a cancer-causing somatic mutation) and F103C (a novel mutation) and these mutations either directly or indirectly hinder DNA binding activity and TLR and cytokine binding of HMGB1. These findings will help in understanding the molecular basis of these promising mutations and functional role of human HMGB1 in cancer and immunological diseases.

However, the computational cost of electronic structure methods drastically increases with length and time scales, which makes these methods difficult for long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations or large-sized systems. Machine-learning techniques can provide accurate potentials that can match the quality of electronic structure calculations, provided sufficient training data. These potentials can then be used to rapidly simulate large and long time-scale phenomena at similar quality to the parent electronic structure approach. Machine-learning potentials usually take a bias-free mathematical form and can be readily developed for a wide variety of systems. Electronic structure calculations have favorable properties\u2013namely that they are noiseless and targeted training data can be produced on-demand\u2013that make them particularly well-suited for machine learning. This paper discusses our modular approach to atomistic machine learning through the development of the open-source Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp), which allows for representations of both the total and atom-centered potential energy surface, in both periodic and non-periodic systems. Potentials developed through the atom-centered approach are simultaneously applicable for systems with various sizes. Interpolation can be enhanced by introducing custom descriptors of the local environment. We demonstrate this in the current work for Gaussian-type, bispectrum, and Zernike-type descriptors. Amp  has an intuitive and modular structure with an interface through the python scripting language yet has parallelizable fortran components for demanding tasks; it is designed to integrate closely with the widely used Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), which makes it compatible with a wide variety of commercial and open-source electronic structure codes. We finally demonstrate that the neural network model inside Amp  can accurately interpolate electronic structure energies as well as forces of thousands of multi-species atomic systems.", "doi": "10.17632/b3jnxf8m7c.1", "publicationDate": "2016-08-19", "dateAvailable": "2016-08-19", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/b3jnxf8m7c", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) are the computation approaches which have been exploited to calculate the transition behavior. For calcium, the ambient crystal structure is the face-centered cubic (fcc) with space group.

However, Neotropical carnivores have so far been scarcely targeted by such studies. The Neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) is a poorly-known species for which local levels of genetic diversity and demographic parameters are virtually absent. We employed non-invasive sampling and amplification of microsatellite loci to investigate population size and density, spatial organization, and relatedness of a wild Neotropical otter population in an Atlantic forest area in southern Brazil. We directly identified 28 individuals and estimate a rather high population density at the study site. Spatial organization analysis indicated that male cumulative displacement was higher than that of females, with the latter sex showing evidence of philopatric behaviour.

II: Open quantum systems, optimal control, and model reduction", "description": "WavePacket is an open-source program package for numeric simulations in quantum dynamics. It can solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schr\u00f6dinger and Liouville\u2013von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows, e.g., to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semi-classical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. Being highly versatile and offering visualization of quantum dynamics \u2018on the fly\u2019, WavePacket is well suited for teaching or research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics as well as in physical or theoretical chemistry. Building on the previous Part I [Comp. Phys. Comm. 213, 223\u2013234 (2017)] which dealt with closed quantum systems and discrete variable representations, the present Part II focuses on the dynamics of open quantum systems, with Lindblad operators modeling dissipation and dephasing. This part also describes the WavePacket function for optimal control of quantum dynamics, building on rapid monotonically convergent iteration methods. Furthermore, two different approaches to dimension reduction implemented in WavePacket are documented here. In the first one, a balancing transformation based on the concepts of controllability and observability Gramians is used to identify states that are neither well controllable nor well observable. Those states are either truncated or averaged out. In the other approach, the H2-error for a given reduced dimensionality is minimized by H2 optimal model reduction techniques, utilizing a bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm.\n\nThe present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.3.0 which is hosted and further developed at the Sourceforge platform, where also extensive Wiki-documentation as well as numerous worked-out demonstration examples with animated graphics can be found.", "doi": "10.17632/9g8b7jychy.1", "publicationDate": "2018-03-27", "dateAvailable": "2018-03-27", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9g8b7jychy", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Applications of SiC to high-temperature and igh-power devices require knowledge of its thermal properties. We have studied the specific heat and thermal conductivities of both cubic SiC and amorphous SiC as functions of temperature. Results show different heat transport behaviors for crystalline and amorphous SiC. A layer of about 4 nm Al2O3 is naturally formed on the surface of aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs). Presence of this layer affects the combustion behavior of ANPs. Using multi-million-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have investigated the combustion behavior of a single ANP. Transition of the combustion mechanism from diffusion to ballistic transportation of atoms is found when the temperature of the preheated aluminum core of the ANP is changed from 3000K to 9000K. Higher initial temperature of the aluminum core results the mechanical breakdown of the alumina shell in the expansion phase of the ANP.; Breaking of the shell provides direct oxidation paths for core aluminum atoms, which results faster oxidation reaction and then faster energy release. Thus, the mechanism of the combustion is transferred from thermodynamics to mechanochemistry regime. Furthermore, when the shell structure of the ANP is changed from thicker crystalline to thinner amorphous, this transition of combustion mechanism is found at lower temperatures. Specially, for initial core temperature of 9000K, the ANP with amorphous shell explodes and results complete shattering of the shell. No large fragment of oxide is found after the explosion except for clusters of tens of oxidized Al atoms, that form a superficial particle and reactivity of which is greatly enhanced.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1822", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1822", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

These histograms represent 2-point spatial correlation functions and are routinely calculated from simulations of soft and condensed matter, where they are referred to as radial distribution functions, and in the analysis of the spatial distributions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Although conceptually simple, the calculation of radial distribution functions via distance binning requires the evaluation of O(N^2) particle-pair distances where N is the number of particles under consideration. CADISHI provides fast parallel implementations of the distance histogram algorithm for the CPU and the GPU, written in templated C++ and CUDA. Orthorhombic and general triclinic periodic boxes are supported, in addition to the non-periodic case. The CPU kernels feature cache-blocking, vectorization and thread-parallelization to obtain high performance. The GPU kernels are tuned to exploit the memory and processor features of current GPUs, demonstrating histogramming rates of up to a factor 40 higher than on a high-end multi-core CPU. To enable high-throughput analyses of molecular dynamics trajectories, the compute kernels are driven by the Python-based CADISHI engine. It implements a producer\u2013consumer data processing pattern and thereby enables the complete utilization of all the CPU and GPU resources available on a specific computer, independent of special libraries such as MPI, covering commodity systems up to high-end HPC nodes.

In common with other membrane protein domains, synaptic domains are characterized by low protein copy numbers and protein crowding, with rapid stochastic turnover of individual molecules. We study here a stochastic lattice model of the receptor-scaffold reaction-diffusion dynamics at synaptic domains that was found previously to capture, at the mean-field level, the self-assembly, stability, and characteristic size of synaptic domains observed in experiments. We show that our stochastic lattice model yields quantitative agreement with mean-field models of nonlinear diffusion in crowded membranes. Through a combination of analytic and numerical solutions of the master equation governing the reaction dynamics at synaptic domains, together with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we find substantial discrepancies between mean-field and stochastic models for the reaction dynamics at synaptic domains. Based on the reaction and diffusion properties of synaptic receptors and scaffolds suggested by previous experiments and mean-field calculations, we show that the stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic receptors and scaffolds provide a simple physical mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the molecular turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the observed single-molecule trajectories, and spatial heterogeneity in the effective rates at which receptors and scaffolds are recycled at the cell membrane. Finally, inspired by our results on synaptic domains, we investigate the diffusion of particles through media with spatially inhomogeneous particle hopping rates, both in the presence and absence of steric constraints on the particle density. Based on the deterministic parts of the corresponding lattice Langevin equations we obtain general solutions for the fractions of all particles in regions with distinct particle hopping rates, for arbitrary spatial dimensions of the system and numbers of distinct particle species. We confirm our general solutions using KMC simulations.

The run input files for these simulations are provided as X_PUFAY_EQ.tpr and the trajectories as X_PUFAY_EQ.xtc, where X stands for the protein (or says 'NOPROT' for the case without protein) and Y for the SDPE concentration.\n\nThe run input files for the free energy of transfer simulations are provided as the tar files; one tar for each protein and one for the protein-free case. Each of these tars contains a folder for each used SDPE concentration, including the more realistic membrane compositions (with a suffix 'REAL'). For each SDPE concentration, the run input files (tpr) and the simulation input parameter files (mdp) for each window in the free energy perturbation are provided. Here, the windows are numbered from 0 to 26, where 0 corresponds to DSPC and 26 to DOPC. Also, for each SDPE concentration, common topology (top), index (ndx) and start configuration (gro) are provided.

Presently, two types of pneumococcal vaccine are available on the market: polysaccharide vaccines (PPV) that are based on capsular polysaccharides of at least 92 different serotypes, and protein-conjugated polysaccharide vaccine (PCV). The PPVs such as PPV23 do not stimulate efficient protective immunity in children under 2\u2009years old, while the PCVs such as PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 that cover 7, 10, and 13 serotypes, respectively, highly protect newborns, but have some disadvantages such as complications in manufacturing, costly production, and also requires refrigeration and multiple injections. Epitope-based vaccines, including varied mixtures of conserved virulence proteins, are a promising alternative to the existing capsular antigen vaccines. In this study, it has been tried to design an efficient subunit vaccine in order to elicit both CTL and HTL responses. The immunodominant epitopes from highly protective antigens of S. pneumoniae (PspA, CbpA, PiuA, and PhtD) were selected from different databanks, such as IEDB, PROPRED, RANKPEP, and MHCPRED. The PspA and CbpA were chosen as CTL epitope stimulants, and PhtD and PiuA were defined as helper epitopes. Because of low immunogenicity of epitope vaccines, PorB protein as a TLR2 agonist was employed to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine. All the peptide segments were fused to each other by proper linkers, and the physicochemical, structural, and immunological characteristics of the construct were also evaluated. To achieve a high-quality 3\u2009D structure of the protein, modeling, refinement, and validation of the final construct were done. Docking and molecular dynamics analyses demonstrated an appropriate and stable interaction between the vaccine and TLR2 during the simulation period. The computational studies suggested the designed vaccine as a novel construct, capable to elicit efficient humoral and cellular immunities, which are crucial for protection against S. pneumoniae.

The algorithm assumes the use of some localized functions as a basis set to represent the spatial degrees of freedom. It relies on an iterative computation of the induced density according to the Dyson-like equation for the linear response function. The current implementation is built upon so-called numerical atomic orbitals. It is suitable for a wide variety of density functional theory (DFT) software. In this work, we demonstrate TDDFT calculations starting from preceding DFT runs with SIESTA, GPAW and PySCF packages, while a coupling with the other DFT packages such as Fireball and OpenMX is planned. The mentioned packages are capable of performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and the speed of our TDDFT implementation makes feasible to perform a configuration average of the optical absorption spectra. Our code is written mostly in Python language allowing for a quick and compact implementation of most numerical methods and data-managing tasks with the help of NumPy/SciPy libraries and Python intrinsic constructs. Part of the code is written in C and Fortran to achieve a competitive speed in particular sections of the algorithm. Many parts of the current algorithm and implementation are useful in other ab initio methods for electronic excited states, such as Hedin\u2019s GW, Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation and DFT with hybrid functionals.

In general, viral protein 40 is the key protein for the oligomerization, the N-terminal loop region in the viral protein 40 and it is essential for the viral replication in Ebola. The electronic structures of native N-terminal loop (His124-Asn134) and metalized (Mn+=Ag+ and Cu2+) complexes are optimized at the M06-2X/LANL2DZ level of theory. Among Mn+-interacted N-loop complexes, Cu2+-interacted N-terminal loop complex has the highest interaction energy of \u2013973.519\u2009kcal/mol and also it has the stabilization energy in the range of 9.92\u2009kcal/mol. The cation-\u03c0 interactions between His124, Pro131 and Arg134 residues are the important factor, which enhances the interaction energy of viral protein 40. Due to the chelation behavior of metal ions, the backbone and the side chains of N-terminal loop regions are deviated from the planarity that results in the formation of classical hydrogen bonds between N-terminal loop regions. Molecular dynamics simulation studies also revealed that the structural transformations of Nloop into a stable \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet folded conformations due to the interaction of Ag+ and Cu2+ ions in the N-terminal loop region. The hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the stability and structural changes in N-terminal loop region.

The system is built as a pyramid of increasing complexity, with two E1 (ubiquitin activating), few dozen E2 (ubiquitin conjugating) and several hundred E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. By collecting and analyzing E3 sequences from the KEGG BRITE database and literature, we assembled a coherent dataset of 563 human E3s and analyzed their various physical features. We found an increase in structural disorder of the system with multiple disorder predictors (IUPred \u2013 E1: 5.97%, E2: 17.74%, E3: 20.03%). E3s that can bind E2 and substrate simultaneously (single subunit E3, ssE3) have significantly higher disorder (22.98%) than E3s in which E2 binding (multi RING-finger, mRF, 0.62%), scaffolding (6.01%) and substrate binding (adaptor/substrate recognition subunits, 17.33%) functions are separated. In ssE3s, the disorder was localized in the substrate/adaptor binding domains, whereas the E2-binding RING/HECT-domains were structured. To demonstrate the involvement of disorder in E3 function, we applied normal modes and molecular dynamics analyses to show how a disordered and highly flexible linker in human CBL (an E3 that acts as a regulator of several tyrosine kinase-mediated signalling pathways) facilitates long-range conformational changes bringing substrate and E2-binding domains towards each other and thus assisting in ubiquitin transfer. E3s with multiple interaction partners (as evidenced by data in STRING) also possess elevated levels of disorder (hubs, 22.90% vs. non-hubs, 18.36%). Furthermore, a search in PDB uncovered 21 distinct human E3 interactions, in 7 of which the disordered region of E3s undergoes induced folding (or mutual induced folding) in the presence of the partner. In conclusion, our data highlights the primary role of structural disorder in the functions of E3 ligases that manifests itself in the substrate/adaptor binding functions as well as the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by long-range conformational transitions.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.84kj5", "publicationDate": "2016-04-26", "dateAvailable": "2016-04-26", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.84kj5", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Monitoring the collapse of a cavitation nanobubble, we observe a focused nanojet at the onset of bubble shrinkage and a water hammer shock wave upon bubble collapse. The nanojet length scales linearly with the nanobubble radius, as observed in experiments on micron-to-millimeter size bubbles. The shock induces dramatic structural changes, including an ice-VII-like structural motif at a particle velocity of approximately 1 km/s. The incipient ice VII formation and the calculated Hugoniot curve are in good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, a substantial number of positive and negative ions appear when the nanojet hits the distal side of the nanobubble and the water hammer shock forms. Furthermore, two promising applications of shock-induced nanobubble collapse have been explored. Our simulations of poration in lipid bilayers due to shock-induced collapse of nanobubbles reveal penetration of nanojets into lipid bilayers. The nanojet impact generates shear flow of water on bilayer leaflets and pressure gradients across them, which transiently enhance the bilayer permeability by creating nanopores through which water molecules translocate across the bilayer. The effects of nanobubble size and temperature on the porosity of lipid bilayers are examined. Finally, the shock-induced collapse of CO2-filled nanobubbles in water is investigated. The energetic nanojet and high-pressure water hammer shock formed during and after collapse of the nanobubble trigger mechano-chemical H2O-CO2 reactions, some of which lead to splitting of water molecules.

Presently, two types of pneumococcal vaccine are available on the market: polysaccharide vaccines (PPV) that are based on capsular polysaccharides of at least 92 different serotypes, and protein-conjugated polysaccharide vaccine (PCV). The PPVs such as PPV23 do not stimulate efficient protective immunity in children under 2\u2009years old, while the PCVs such as PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 that cover 7, 10, and 13 serotypes, respectively, highly protect newborns, but have some disadvantages such as complications in manufacturing, costly production, and also requires refrigeration and multiple injections. Epitope-based vaccines, including varied mixtures of conserved virulence proteins, are a promising alternative to the existing capsular antigen vaccines. In this study, it has been tried to design an efficient subunit vaccine in order to elicit both CTL and HTL responses. The immunodominant epitopes from highly protective antigens of S. pneumoniae (PspA, CbpA, PiuA, and PhtD) were selected from different databanks, such as IEDB, PROPRED, RANKPEP, and MHCPRED. The PspA and CbpA were chosen as CTL epitope stimulants, and PhtD and PiuA were defined as helper epitopes. Because of low immunogenicity of epitope vaccines, PorB protein as a TLR2 agonist was employed to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine. All the peptide segments were fused to each other by proper linkers, and the physicochemical, structural, and immunological characteristics of the construct were also evaluated. To achieve a high-quality 3\u2009D structure of the protein, modeling, refinement, and validation of the final construct were done. Docking and molecular dynamics analyses demonstrated an appropriate and stable interaction between the vaccine and TLR2 during the simulation period. The computational studies suggested the designed vaccine as a novel construct, capable to elicit efficient humoral and cellular immunities, which are crucial for protection against S. pneumoniae.

Current therapeutic strategies of Diabetic Nephropathy are based on control of modifiable risks like hypertension, glucose levels, and dyslipidemia. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is implicated in several metabolic syndromes including Diabetic Nephropathy, besides obesity, insulin insensitivity, dislipidemia, inflammation, and hypertension. In the present study, virtual screening of 617 compounds from two different public databases was done against PPAR-\u03b3 with an objective to find a possible lead compound. Two softwares, PyRx and iGEMDOCK, were used to achieve the docking accuracy in order to avoid loss of candidate compounds. Rosiglitazone (used to treat Diabetic Nephropathy) was taken as the standard compound. A total of 30 compounds with good binding affinity with PPAR-\u03b3 were selected for further filtering, on the basis of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). The interaction profiling of these 30 compounds, showed a minimum of one and maximum of three interactions with reference to rosiglitazone (SER-289, HIS-449, HIS-323, TYR-473).

However, it is a great challenge to design an efficient parallelization framework that continues to scale on future architectures due to the complexity of real-world applications and the variety of multi-core/many-core platforms. \u2767 To address this challenge, I propose a hierarchical optimization framework that maps applications to hardware by exploiting multiple levels of parallelization: (1) Inter-node level parallelism via spatial decomposition; (2) inter-core level parallelism via cellular decomposition; and (3) single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization. The framework includes application-based SIMD analysis and optimization, which allows application scientists to determine whether their applications are viable for SIMDization and provide various code transformation techniques to enhance the SIMD efficiency as well as simple recipes when compiler auto-vectorization fails. I also propose a suite of optimization strategies to achieve ideal on-chip inter-core strong scalability on emerging many-core architectures: (1) A divide-and-conquer algorithm adaptive to local memory; (2) a novel data layout to improve data locality; (3) on-chip locality-aware parallel algorithms to enhance data reuse; and (4) a pipeline algorithm using data transfer agent to orchestrate computation and memory operations to hide latency to shared memory. \u2767 I have applied the framework to three scientific applications, which represent most of the numerical classes in the seven dwarfs (which are known to cover most high performance computing applications): (1) Stencil computation, specifically lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)for fluid flow simulation; (2) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation; and (3) molecular fragment analysis via connected component detection. \u2767 I have achieved high inter-node, inter-core (multithreading), and SIMD efficiency on various computing platforms: (1) For LBM, inter-node parallel efficiency 0.978 on 131,072 BlueGene/P processors, multithreading efficiency 0.882 on 6 cores of a Cell BE, and SIMD efficiency 0.780 using 4-element vector registers of a Cell BE; (2) for MD simulation, inter-node parallel efficiency 0.985 on 106,496 BlueGene/L processors, and inter-core multithreading parallel efficiency 0.99 on the 64-core Godson-T many-core architecture; (3) for molecular fragment analysis, nearly linear inter-node strong scalability up to 50 million vertices molecular graph on 32 computing nodes, and over 13-fold inter-core speedup on 16 cores. In addition, a simple performance model based on hierarchical parallelization is derived, which suggests that the optimization scheme is likely to scale well toward exascale. Furthermore, I have analyzed the impact of architectural features on applications' performance to find that certain architectural features are essential for these optimizations. \u2767 This research not only suggests viable optimization techniques for broad scientific applications on future many-core parallel supercomputing platforms, but also provides guidance on effective architectural design of future supercomputing systems.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c127-624895", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-624895", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

In general, viral protein 40 is the key protein for the oligomerization, the N-terminal loop region in the viral protein 40 and it is essential for the viral replication in Ebola. The electronic structures of native N-terminal loop (His124-Asn134) and metalized (Mn+=Ag+ and Cu2+) complexes are optimized at the M06-2X/LANL2DZ level of theory. Among Mn+-interacted N-loop complexes, Cu2+-interacted N-terminal loop complex has the highest interaction energy of \u2013973.519\u2009kcal/mol and also it has the stabilization energy in the range of 9.92\u2009kcal/mol. The cation-\u03c0 interactions between His124, Pro131 and Arg134 residues are the important factor, which enhances the interaction energy of viral protein 40.

Integrative analyses showed both conservation and divergence in regulatory circuitry between human and mouse early development, and between na\u00efve human pluripotency in vivo and human embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, we also found widespread open chromatin at the 2-cell stage despite its minimal transcription activities. Such accessible chromatin loci are readily found at CpG-rich promoters. Unexpectedly, many others are located in distal regions enriched for transcription factor binding sites and overlap with partially methylated domains (PMDs) in human oocytes. A large portion of these regions then rapidly become inaccessible upon zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Importantly, such drastic transition of chromatin accessibility during ZGA is well conserved in mouse embryos. Furthermore, it strongly correlates with the reprogramming of non-canonical H3K4me3 (ncH3K4me3), a form of histone mark that is uniquely present in oocytes and pre-ZGA embryos and contributes to genome silencing. Finally, both the reprogramming of chromatin accessibility and ncH3K4me3 during ZGA is completely blocked upon transcription inhibition, indicating a critical role of zygotic transcription in shaping early epigenomes. Together, these data revealed conserved chromatin state transition during ZGA in human and mouse early development. Overall design: ATAC-seq and RNA-seq were applied on human pre-implantation embryos and mouse transcription blocked embryos to examine the chromatin state as well as their transcriptome", "doi": "10.26036/cnphis0002746", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": "2018-05-04", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.26036%2Fcnphis0002746", "method": null, "source": "cngb.cga", "type_cont": null},

Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sam- pling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfor- tunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncer- tain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation timescales, so proper sampling with cur- rent techniques can require prohibitively long sim- ulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligandis rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over two orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics sim- ulation. This is a first step towards applying this methodology to pharmaceutically-relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding Modes of Ligands using Enhanced Sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.

Current therapeutic strategies of Diabetic Nephropathy are based on control of modifiable risks like hypertension, glucose levels, and dyslipidemia. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is implicated in several metabolic syndromes including Diabetic Nephropathy, besides obesity, insulin insensitivity, dislipidemia, inflammation, and hypertension. In the present study, virtual screening of 617 compounds from two different public databases was done against PPAR-\u03b3 with an objective to find a possible lead compound. Two softwares, PyRx and iGEMDOCK, were used to achieve the docking accuracy in order to avoid loss of candidate compounds. Rosiglitazone (used to treat Diabetic Nephropathy) was taken as the standard compound. A total of 30 compounds with good binding affinity with PPAR-\u03b3 were selected for further filtering, on the basis of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). The interaction profiling of these 30 compounds, showed a minimum of one and maximum of three interactions with reference to rosiglitazone (SER-289, HIS-449, HIS-323, TYR-473). The fulfilling of ADMET analysis criteria of 30 compounds led to the selection of four compounds (ZINC ID 00181552, 00276456, 00298314, 00448009). Molecular dynamics simulation of these lead compounds in complex with PPAR-\u03b3 revealed that three of the four compounds formed a stable complex in the ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-\u03b3 during 20-ns simulation. Hence, these three (ZINC ID 00181552, 00276456, 00298314) of the four compounds are potential candidates for experimental validation of biological activity against PPAR-\u03b3 in future drug discovery studies.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.5091859", "publicationDate": "2017-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.5091859", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

The Michael addition and ternary covalent complex formation are considered as important steps involved in the inhibition mechanism of a known anticancer drug, 5-FU. The effect of functional group substitution on the C-5 position of dUMP substrate with halogen atoms (F-, Cl- and Br- ) and electron withdrawing (CN-, NO\u2082-) and donating (NH\u2082-, OH-) groups towards the TS stability is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation technique. The simulated results showed that an additionally unique hydrogen bond between the substituted group of dUMP analogues and the hydroxyl group of Y94 was observed in most systems except CldUMP and BrdUMP analogues. The MM/PBSA binding free energy provides the orders of averaged binding affinity are: CldUMP ~ FdUMP &gt; dUMP &gt; BrdUMP for halogen analogues and CNdUMP ~ NO\u2082dUMP &gt; OHdUMP ~ NH\u2082dUMP for electron withdrawing and donating analogues. Based on the B3LYP/6-31+G*-CHARMM hybrid method, the Michael addition and ternary covalent complex formation between dUMP and mTHF substrates to form the methylene bridging intermediate is determined via a concerted mechanism. By following the several tests of QM/MM approaches, the SCS-MP2 method with aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets is selected for reaction energy profile evaluation.

Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles and ortho-methoxycinnamic acid (OMCA) based PR fluids have attracted recent attention because they require no special synthesis. It has been shown that in the presence of trans-OMCA, CTAB micelles form long and wormlike micelles, and upon irradiation by UV light, OMCA undergoes a photoisomerization from its trans to its cis form, and the viscosity of the micellar solution is reduced by 4 orders of magnitude. This is feasible mainly due to the alteration of the molecular packing at the micellar interface. Our Aim is to investigate the effect of OMCA on the microscopic dynamics of CTAB micelles using quasielastic neutron scattering and establish a correlation with the observed viscosity.", "doi": "10.5286/isis.e.rb1820153", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5286%2Fisis.e.rb1820153", "method": null, "source": "bl.stfc", "type_cont": null},

In this research, we address the question of how application programmers can interface with tools and automatically search a space of application-level parameters that are believed to significantly impact the performance of an application. We begin with applications for which a programmer has identified a set of integer-valued parameters believed to impact the performance of the application significantly.; We explore two techniques for modeling performance sensitivity of application-level parameters. First, we propose qualitative parameter models that capture common behaviors of an optimization parameter, and use high-level programmer-specified models of the expected performance behavior of individual parameters. A second modeling technique uses statistical methods on a small sample of parameter values to derive a functional model, and to dynamically identify the neighborhood of the best-performing result. By capitalizing on properties of these models, we develop search algorithms to prune the multi-variate search space for the collection of parameters associated with an application.; We study performance tuning of three large scientific applications: the LS-DYNA Solver, the visualization component of molecular dynamics simulation, and warping component of biomedical image analysis. We validate our models by comparing against performance results from an exhaustive set of experiments across the parameter range. When compared with the exhaustive experimental data, we show that we are able to drastically reduce search time, examining an average of less than 5% of the search space. Our experimental results show speedups of up to 12.83X as compared to the worst-case in user-given parameter ranges, and speedups of up to 1.75X as compared to the user default parameter value.; To support model-guided performance tuning, we have developed a tool called a code isolator. Its purpose is to extract a key computation from the application and creates an executable program, including representative input data. To derive an isolated code fragment that uses storage efficiently and has similar memory hierarchy behavior to the original computation, we develop compiler and runtime optimizations to limit the input data and number of parameters as well as to warm up the cache state. We applied this tool to two case study applications, UMT2K and the LS-DYNA Solver, reducing their size and execution time by several orders of magnitude.; In considering the burden of achieving high performance for developers of current scientific and engineering applications on complex high-end computing platforms, model-guided performance tuning is a feasible and useful tool for finding the best-performing application-level parameters.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m2398", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m2398", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

However, macroevolutionary analyses based upon molecular phylogenies have difficulty inferring extinction dynamics, raising questions about whether the neontological record can contribute to an understanding of the decline phenomenon. Two recently developed diversification methods for molecular phylogenies (RPANDA and BAMM) incorporate models that theoretically have the capacity to capture decline dynamics by allowing extinction to be higher than speciation. However, the performance of these frameworks over a wide range of decline scenarios has not been studied. Here we investigate the behavior of these methods under decline scenarios caused by decreasing speciation and increasing extinction through time on simulated trees at fixed intervals over diversity trajectories with expansion and decline phases. We also compared method performance over a comprehensive dataset of 214 empirical trees. Our results show that both methods perform equally well when varying speciation rates control decline. When decline was only caused by an increase in extinction rates both methods wrongly assign the variation in net diversification to a drop in speciation, even though the positive gamma values of those trees would suggest otherwise. We also found a tendency for RPANDA to favor increasing extinction and BAMM to favor decreasing speciation as the most common cause of decline in empirical trees. Overall our results shed light on the limitations of both methods, encouraging researchers to carefully interpret the results from diversification studies.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.tt10r84", "publicationDate": "2018-05-11", "dateAvailable": "2018-05-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tt10r84", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Protein-protein complexes, lasting from microseconds to years, often involve induced-fit, challenging computational or kinetic analysis. Charybdotoxin (CTX), a peptide from the Leiurus scorpion venom, blocks voltage-gated K+-channels in a unique example of binding/unbinding simplicity. CTX plugs the external mouth of K+-channels pore, stopping K+-ion conduction, without inducing conformational changes. Conflicting with a tight binding, we show that external permeant ions enhance CTX-dissociation, implying a path connecting the pore, in the toxin-bound channel, with the external solution. This sensitivity is explained if CTX wobbles between several bound conformations, producing transient events that restore the electrical and ionic trans-pore gradients. Wobbling may originate from a network of contacts in the interaction interface that are in dynamic stochastic equilibria.

The current study not only adapts a broad-spectrum strategy for the lucid design of small molecule modulators but also provides novel allosteric inhibitors for DSPI, to investigate its function and potential as a therapeutic target. Docking analysis revealed that the compound 10252273, bound to the specific allosteric site, interacted with Glu118, unique amino acid residue of the active binding pocket, hence indicates the presence of a competitive allosteric site. The current study thus identifies and characterizes inhibitors by targeting the normal binding site and also reports the presence of the competo-allosteric site in the same binding tunnel as the normal site. Molecular docking studies proposed two chemical compounds that share a benzamide-benzimidazole (BB) backbone as potent inhibitors that can obstruct the mechanism of DSPI by targeting both the normal and proposed allosteric binding sites. MD simulations further revealed the disruption of the normal binding site due to the displacement of critical residues Cys146 and Glu118. The rearrangement of H-bond pattern, pi-pi interactions, and strong hydrophobic interactions were observed at both the binding sites. The allosteric pocket inhibitor exhibited improved binding energy than the normal site inhibitor based on MMGBSA and MMPBSA analysis.

However, the translational dynamics that link steady-state mRNA with protein levels are not well understood. In this study, we bridge this disconnect by measuring genome-wide translation using ribosome profiling, through five stages of the P. falciparum blood phase developmental cycle. Our findings show that transcription and translation are tightly coupled, with overt translational control occurring for less than 10% of the transcriptome. Translationally regulated genes are predominantly associated with merozoite egress functions. We systematically define mRNA 5\u2032 leader sequences, and 3\u2032 UTRs, as well as antisense transcripts, along with ribosome occupancy for each, and establish that accumulation of ribosomes on 5\u2032 leaders is a common transcript feature.

For example, sites actively undergoing DNA replication, high-level transcription, and repair of double-strand breaks coalesce into foci, although the significance and mechanisms giving rise to these dynamic structures are poorly understood.  In S. cerevisiae, replication origins exhibit characteristic subnuclear localizations prior to S phase that anticipate their initiation timing and/or efficiency during S phase: origins found within the nuclear interior in G1 phase initiate early and efficiently in S phase while origins found associated with the nuclear periphery in G1 phase initiate later and less efficiently.  In this study, we link interior localization of replication origins in G1 phase with Fkh1 activity, which is required for their early replication timing.  Using a Fkh1-dependent origin relocalization assay, we determine that execution of Dbf4-dependent kinase function, including Cdc45 loading, results in dynamic relocalization of a replication origin from the nuclear periphery to the interior in G1 phase.  Origin mobility increases substantially with Fkh1-driven relocalization.

The ancestors of these patients are believed to originate from the southern province of China. Our previous study showed that this mutation leads to reduced abundance of the TPO protein and loss of TPO enzyme activity in a Malaysian-Chinese family with goitrous hypothyroidism. The aim of our study was to provide further data on the incidence of the c.2268dup mutation in a cohort of Malaysian-Chinese and its possible phenotypic effects. Setting: Cohort study. Participants: Twelve biologically unrelated Malaysian-Chinese patients with congenital hypothyroidism were recruited in this study. All patients showed high TSH and low fT4 levels at the time of diagnosis with proven presence of thyroid gland Primary outcome measure: Screening of the c.2268dup mutation in the TPO gene in all patients was carried out using PCR-direct DNA sequencing method. Secondary outcome measure: Further screening for mutations in other exonic regions of the TPO gene was carried out if the patient is a carrier for the c.2268dup mutation Results: The c.2268dup mutation was detected in 4 out of the 12 patients. Apart from the c.2268dup and a previously documented mutation, c.2647C&gt;T, two novel TPO alterations namely c.670_672del and c.1186C&gt;T were also detected in our patients.

During development, there\u2019s a period of sensitivity called the \u2018critical period\u2019 when brief monocular deprivation (MD) alters ocular dominance (OD) in primary visual cortex (V1). There are several factors thought to mediate the closure of the critical period such as maturation of inhibition, myelination, and molecular cues. One of these molecular cues is the nogo-66 receptor (NgR1), as deletion of ngr1 prevents closure of the critical period for OD plasticity and allows for recovery of visual acuity in adulthood following long-term monocular deprivation (LTMD). \u2767 NgR1\u2019s restriction of neurite outgrowth in vitro led to the hypothesis that NgR1 restricts developmental visual plasticity by restricting the rates of addition and loss of axonal boutons, as explored in chapter 2. Chronic in-vivo 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) has become a standard for observing experience-dependent changes in anatomical plasticity over time in vivo. Various experiential manipulations have elicited changes in dendritic spine dynamics in different cortical areas, including visual cortex. However, the effect of altered experience on axonal bouton dynamics had not been studied prior to the paper published in chapter 2, where I asked whether 4D MD or recovery of visual acuity was accompanied by altered axonal bouton dynamics in ngr1-/- mice. I found that neither alteration in visual experince affected the rates of axonal bouton gain and loss in V1. This supports a model where anatomical changes correlating with functional visual plasticity are largely postsynaptic while axonal structures remain relatively stable. \u2767 Visual cortex is subdivided into lamina. It remains poorly understood whether each layer plays a different role in the expression of OD plasticity. In cats, layer IV is relatively resistant to OD shifts, although this is not true in mice, as shifts in layer IV have been recorded in as little as 1D. In chapter 3, I examined whether removing the brakes on plasticity in individual layers using conditional deletion of ngr1 unmasks plasticity in adults. I also examined how shifts in OD progressed in a laminar fashion. I found that deleting ngr1 in excitatory neurons of layer IV enabled OD plasticity throughout all layers through a disinhibitory circuit. Further, in mice lacking ngr1 in layer IV and critical period WT mice, 2D MD produced a dramatic shift in eye dominance in layer IV with only modest shifts in layers II/III and V. This data supports a model where plasticity in cortex is regulated in a feed-forward manner from layer IV.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-221655", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-221655", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Multilayer and irreversible adsorption behaviors are commonly observed. In this work, protein adsorption behavior at the solid-liquid interface was investigated by a combination of experimental Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflectance (FTIR/ATR) studies and computer simulations: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and hybrid Genetic-Algorithm (GA) schemes.; BSA, lysozyme, IgG and fibrinogen adsorption was studied with FTIR/ATR in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffers on a Ge surface. Buffer choice was shown to drastically affect adsorption kinetics. In comparison with Tris-HCl, PBS buffer depresses the adsorption of BSA, IgG and fibrinogen in the prolonged quasi-linear kinetic region while lysozyme adsorption is relatively insensitive to buffer choice. Buffer concentration can also significantly affect protein adsorption. The secondary structures in the adsorbed phase are generally quite different from the bulk structure; however, buffer choice has negligible effect on structural evolution. Significant secondary structure changes occur during adsorption. The secondary structures in the adsorbed phase are inhomogeneous. The role of phosphate ions in PBS buffer and their effect on protein adsorption are rather complex. Phosphate ions adsorb competitively against protein molecules and their deprotonation equilibrium can be altered at the solid-liquid interface due to the adsorbed protein.; The effect of surface on adsorption is examined by adsorbing IgG on various polymer-coated surfaces. IgG adsorption is higher on more hydrophobic surface. IgG molecules adsorbed in layers near hydrophilic solid surfaces suffer less secondary structure changes.; The behavior of lysozyme during adsorption on a hydrogen-terminated Si surface (Si-H) is studied using MD simulations. Although atomistic simulations are highly time-consuming for direct observations of complete secondary structure changes, indications of molecular deformations are observed over nanosecond simulation time scale. Lysozyme molecule undergoes deformation onto the Si-H surface, as is evidenced by the reduction in the volume, the increase in solvent accessible surface area, the change of the overall shape, and certain amount of alteration in secondary structures. The main \u03b1-helix domains experience some loss while the beta-sheet domains remain almost intact. The hydrophobic character of the surface is believed to contribute to the loss of the organized structures of the amino residues in close proximity to the surface.; An efficient hybrid GA/spatial-grid method was developed to search for low adsorption-energy orientations and locations of a protein molecule on a solid surface. The surface and the protein molecule are treated as rigid bodies, whereas the bulk fluid is represented by spatial grids. The hybrid search procedure consists of two interlinked loops. In 1st loop (A), a GA is employed to identify promising regions for the global energy minimum, whereas a local optimizer with the derivative-free Nelder-Mead method is used to search for the lowest-energy orientation within the identified regions. In 2nd loop (B), new population is generated and competitive solution from loop A is improved. The switching between two loops is adaptively controlled by similarity analysis. We test the method for lysozyme adsorption on a hydrophobic Si-H (110) surface in implicit water. The hybrid search method was shown to have faster convergence and better solution accuracy compared with the conventional GA, which suffered from premature convergence.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1641", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1641", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Stage 1, initiated by the ANP temperature exceeding the melting temperature of the aluminum core, is seen to be a confined burning stage.  Oxygen penetrating from the core-shell interface reacts exothermically with the core metal, releasing local heat.  When this heating drives the local temperature of the shell to exceed the melting temperature of alumina (the shell), a sudden increase in the number of oxidation reactions is seen.  The development of asymmetry in the shell and increased uptake of oxygen from the exterior also support the conclusion that melting of the shell initiates Stage 2.  Local heating continues until the shell temperature reaches a critical temperature (T = 3000 K), at which point aluminum atom ejections from the exterior of the shell into the surrounding oxygen begin.  These ejections lead to direct oxidation outside the ANP and the formation of oxygen-rich clusters.  Both internal and external oxidation continue throughout the remainder of Stage 3, leading to complete oxidation of the particle.; After having determined the basic mechanisms in the 46nm simulation, the effect of initial temperature on the oxidation stages is studied.  Three 26nm ANP simulation systems, heated to 1100 K, 1200 K, and 1400 K, are analyzed using the tools developed in the preceding study.  By comparing these systems, it is determined that many of the features identified in the model are strongly dependent on the initial temperature of the nanoparticle (including the time delay to the onset of each stage and the rate of oxidation in stages 2 and 3), while others have a relatively small dependence on the initial temperature provided (including the initial rate of heating, the rate of aluminum ejections in stage 3, and the overall temperature of a system of a given size).; Finally, the tools and models developed in this study are applied to the case of a flash-heated ANP, providing a comparison point to aid in the understanding of this more complicated reaction.  From this, it is determined that the initial heating of flash-heated ANPs is dominated by a mechanical mixing mechanism resulting from the pressure-driven volume expansion of the flash-heated core.  This volume expansion significantly increases the chemical reaction zone of the core-shell oxidation, resulting in the very fast release of energy seen in the flash-heating cases.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3079", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3079", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

They do this by combining both extracorporeal and intracellular digestion. Whereas many high throughput (\u201c-omics\u201d) techniques focus on biomolecules in spider venom, so far this approach has not yet been applied to investigate the protein composition of spider midgut diverticula (MD) and digestive fluid (DF). Results: We here report on our investigations of both MD and DF of the spider Nephilingis (Nephilengys) cruentata through the use of next generation sequencing and shotgun proteomics. This shows that the DF is composed of a variety of hydrolases including peptidases, carbohydrases, lipases and nuclease, as well as of toxins and regulatory proteins. We detect 25 astacins in the DF. Phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding transcript(s) in Arachnida suggests that astacins have acquired an unprecedented role for extracorporeal digestion in Araneae, with different orthologs used by each family. The results of a comparative study of spiders in distinct physiological conditions allow us to propose some digestion mechanisms in this interesting animal taxon. Conclusion: All the high throughput data allowed the demonstration that DF is a secretion originating from the MD. We identified enzymes involved in the extracellular and intracellular phases of digestion. Besides that, data analyses show a large gene duplication event in Araneae digestive process evolution, mainly of astacin genes. We were also able to identify proteins expressed and translated in the digestive system, which until now had been exclusively associated to venom glands.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.b34s4", "publicationDate": "2016-09-09", "dateAvailable": "2016-09-09", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b34s4", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Furthermore, the subtleties of the reactive surfaces and the effect of external forces such as solvent electrostatics and molecular collisions on these surfaces often play a major role in the reaction outcome.  Many of these external effects begin influencing the reaction within tens of femtoseconds, requiring sophisticated experimental techniques in order to observe dynamics on these timescales.; Ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy is employed to study the benchmark ICN \u00c3 photodissociation reaction.  This prototypical triatomic system is known to produce a highly non-equilibrium distribution of rotationally excited cyano radicals.  The generation of these rotors comes from a non-adiabatic transition which applies extra torque to an already rapidly bending I-CN bond and leads to two product states corresponding to the I*(\u00b2P1/2) + cold CN and I(\u00b2P3/2) + hot CN channel.  Simulations show that this rotationally excited CN pushes solvent molecules out of the way to create a cavity where free rotation takes place for several picoseconds.  Our hypothesis is that this spinning CN resembles a gas phase molecule, and thus should have a gas phase spectral signature.; Although the relaxation of the hot CN takes place on relatively long time scales for ultrafast spectroscopists, the initial curve crossing event takes place much earlier (&lt;30 fs) and not much is known about the influence of the solvent on this process.  Using sub 40 fs DUV pulses compressed by a novel Gires-Tournois pulse compression system and multiplexed  broadband probing, we can interrogate this reaction at much higher levels of detail than previously possible.  A clear signature from the gas-phase-like CN B\u2190X transition is observed in both water and ethanol.  The spectral contributions of I(\u00b2P3/2)  and I*(\u00b2P1/2)  can be removed from the transient spectrum, because of new and independent experiments also reported here that capture these spectra by photodetachment of iodide in ethanol.  This analysis allows us to watch the evolution of the CN band and estimate first pass curve-crossing probabilities for the first time in solution.; Semiclassical molecular dynamics simulations of ICN bond breaking in water including the non-adiabatic transition, allow us to microscopically break down the energy flow which takes place immediately after dissociation.  Using a spectroscopic sorting criteria which follows only freely dissociated trajectories, we can compare the simulation directly to our experimental observables for the first time.; Future work is needed to measure the equilibrium spectrum of the CN radical in the absence of iodine transients as a last reference, but, with our current time resolution and the ability to simultaneously image the absorption spectrum of multiple transient species as a function of time, we are much closer to extracting all pertinent information from a movie of this benchmark solution phase reaction occurring in real time.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3636", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3636", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The accuracy of these methods depends on both an adequate underlying model and the appropriate implementation of fossil evidence as calibration points. We explore the effect of these in Poaceae (grasses), a diverse plant lineage with a very limited fossil record, focusing particularly on dating the early divergences in the group. We show that molecular dating based on a dataset of plastid markers is strongly dependent on the model assumptions. In particular, an acceleration of evolutionary rates at the base of Poaceae followed by a deceleration in the descendants strongly biases methods that assume an autocorrelation of rates. This problem can be circumvented by using markers that have lower rate variation, and we show that phylogenetic markers extracted from complete nuclear genomes can be a useful complement to the more commonly used plastid markers. However, estimates of divergence times remain strongly affected by different implementations of fossil calibration points. Analyses calibrated with only macrofossils lead to estimates for the age of core Poaceae around 51-55 Ma, but the inclusion of microfossil evidence pushes this age to 74-82 Ma and leads to lower estimated evolutionary rates in grasses.

These molecular cutoffs permit the taking into account of relations between more than two atoms by using (dis-)similarity multi-metrics and the concepts related with topological and Euclidean-geometric distances. To this end, the kth two-, three- and four-tuple topological and geometric neighbourhood quotient (NQ) total (or local-fragment) spatial-(dis)similarity matrices are defined, to represent 3D information corresponding to the relations between two, three and four atoms of the molecular structures that satisfy certain cutoff criteria. First, an analysis of a diverse chemical space for the most common values of topological/Euclidean-geometric distances, bond/dihedral angles, triangle/quadrilateral perimeters, triangle area and volume was performed in order to determine the intervals to take into account in the cutoff procedures. A variability analysis based on Shannon\u2019s entropy reveals that better distribution patterns are attained with the descriptors based on the cutoffs proposed (QuBiLS-MIDAS NQ-MDs) with regard to the results obtained when all inter-atomic relations are considered (QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs \u2013 \u2018Keep All\u2019). A principal component analysis shows that the novel molecular cutoffs codify chemical information captured by the respective QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs, as well as information not captured by the latter.

These molecular cutoffs permit the taking into account of relations between more than two atoms by using (dis-)similarity multi-metrics and the concepts related with topological and Euclidean-geometric distances. To this end, the kth two-, three- and four-tuple topological and geometric neighbourhood quotient (NQ) total (or local-fragment) spatial-(dis)similarity matrices are defined, to represent 3D information corresponding to the relations between two, three and four atoms of the molecular structures that satisfy certain cutoff criteria. First, an analysis of a diverse chemical space for the most common values of topological/Euclidean-geometric distances, bond/dihedral angles, triangle/quadrilateral perimeters, triangle area and volume was performed in order to determine the intervals to take into account in the cutoff procedures. A variability analysis based on Shannon\u2019s entropy reveals that better distribution patterns are attained with the descriptors based on the cutoffs proposed (QuBiLS-MIDAS NQ-MDs) with regard to the results obtained when all inter-atomic relations are considered (QuBiLS-MIDAS KA-MDs \u2013 \u2018Keep All\u2019).

For example, fibrils of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), \u03b1-synuclein, and amyloid-\u03b2 are pathological hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively. Understanding of fibril structure and that of the protofilaments that constitute the fibrils will help to reveal the mechanism of fibril formation in human diseases and to facilitate therapeutic intervention. However, the fibril structures of full-length amyloid proteins/peptides are difficult to determine by direct experimental approaches since they are neither soluble nor crystallizable. \u2767 The goals of this thesis are to develop algorithms, programs and protocols for the modeling and determination of amyloid fibril structures based on experimental data mainly obtained from election paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electron microscopy (EM), and then to use the resulting models for explaining previously unclear aspects of the experimental data and for aiding experimental design to obtain more structural details of the amyloid fibrils. \u2767 In the thesis work, a simulation protocol for modeling amyloid protofilaments mainly based on EPR data was developed. This protocol was demonstrated to be able to produce structures of hIAPP protofilaments consistent with the experimental data. Then, to investigate the properties of the protofilament structures obtained and to generate fibril models consisting of more than one protofilament, a new program, MFIBRIL, was developed for flexible construction of fibrils from a monomeric unit. Several potential models of the hIAPP fibril were constructed using MFIBRIL and then refined by equilibration using molecular dynamics simulations in the NAMD software package. The refined models were evaluated by predicting the ring-to-ring distances using the MFIBRIL analysis tool and the inter-spin label distances and residue mobilities using PRONOX (another program developed in our laboratory) and comparing the predictions to the experimental data. This work led to identification of a favorable hIAPP fibril model consisting of two protofilaments with strong hydrophobic interactions between I26 and V32 surrounding hydrophilic interactions between S28 and T30 in the second \u03b2-strand (C-terminal) regions. The programs and protocols developed in this work are applicable to structural determination of other amyloid fibrils. \u2767 In addition to the modeling of amyloid fibrils, two other projects are described in the thesis. The first is addition to the solvation function of WATGEN (a program developed in our laboratory for modeling the water network at protein-peptide interfaces) to protein-RNA interfaces and investigation of the features of solvated protein-RNA interfaces. The second project involves modeling of the transport mechanism of the human dipeptide transporter (hPEPT1).", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-234407", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-234407", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The present work focuses on the construction and application of two distinct techniques for the simulation of such systems. These methods involve large-scale changes in the system configuration and have the potential to be applicable to a variety of systems. These methods were used to study the critical behavior in a Sine-Gordon lattice model and for achieving enhanced conformational sampling in an all-atom model of proteins. \u2767 A novel switching algorithm is described in which a reverse Monte Carlo method is implemented. Here, the potential is stochastically modified before the system configuration is moved. This new algorithm facilitates a generalized formulation of cluster-type Monte Carlo methods, and the generalization makes it possible to derive cluster algorithms for systems with both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. This Reverse Monte Carlo has been applied to study the roughening transition in the Sine-Gordon model and high-accuracy simulations for system sizes up to 1024X1024 were carried out to examine the logarithmic divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature. This logarithmic divergence is a clear evidence that the transition belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless type. \u2767 Proteins and other biomolecules like RNAs are extremely difficult systems to simulate because of the large system sizes involved and the complexity of interactions present. The time-scales over which interesting phenomena occur also makes it difficult for Molecular Dynamics techniques to do full justice in such systems. A loop closure Monte Carlo algorithm is derived and implemented for simulation of proteins at ambient temperatures. The loop closure method generates alternative structures for an internal segment of a chain when atomic coordinates of the atoms outside the segment are fixed. The formulation makes use of a novel representation of boundary constraints and allows the loop closure problem to be reduced in complexity from a 6-variable 6-constraint problem to a 4-variable 4-constraint problem. The proposed method is no longer limited to small loops, but can be used to close loops of arbitrarily large sizes. This brings to life the possibility to facilitate very large conformational sampling with each move.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c127-621759", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-621759", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Mutations in SF3B1 are associated with 80% cases of refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS), a subtype of MDS. SF3B1K700E is the most frequently mutated site among mutations on SF3B1. Yet the molecular mechanisms on how mutations of splicing factors lead to defective erythropoiesis are not clear. SF3B1K700E mutant binds to an RNA binding protein, RBM15, stronger than the wild type SF3B1 protein in co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, K700E mutant alters the RNA splicing of transcription factors TAL1 and GATA1. Via alternative RNA splicing, a novel short TAL1 transcript variant (TAL1s) is generated. Enhanced interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 promotes the production of full-length TAL1 (TAL1fl) mRNA, while reduction of RBM15 protein level via PRMT1-mediated degradation pathway changes TAL1s/TAL1fl ratio in favor of TAL1s. TAL1s contains the helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain but not the N terminal region upstream of the DNA binding domain. The TAL1s protein loses its interaction with ETO2, which represses early erythropoiesis. In this vein, overexpression of TAL1s stimulates the transcription of \u03b2-hemoglobin in human leukemia K562 cells and promotes erythroid differentiation of human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured in erythropoietin-containing medium.

By probing the E. coli 30S ribosome subunit, we established that the reactivity pattern of lysine residues quantitatively reflects structure models derived from X-ray crystallography. We also used the strategy to assess differences in three conformations of purified human spliceosomes in the context of recent cryo-electron microscopy models. Our results demonstrate that the probing method yields powerful biochemical information that helps contextualize architectural rearrangements of intermediate resolution structures of macromolecular complexes, often solved in multiple conformations.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.8293439", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.8293439", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

Molecular timings have been recently used to suggest that environmental global change have shaped the evolutionary history of diverse terrestrial organisms. Living xenarthrans (armadillos, anteaters and sloths) constitute an ideal model for studying the influence of past environmental changes on species diversification. Indeed, extant xenarthran species are relicts from an evolutionary radiation enhanced by their isolation in South America during the Tertiary era, a period for which major climate variations and tectonic events are relatively well documented.\n\nRESULTS: We applied a Bayesian approach to three nuclear genes in order to relax the molecular clock assumption while accounting for differences in evolutionary dynamics among genes and incorporating paleontological uncertainties. We obtained a molecular time scale for the evolution of extant xenarthrans and other placental mammals. Divergence time estimates provide substantial evidence for contemporaneous diversification events among independent xenarthran lineages. This correlated pattern of diversification might possibly relate to major environmental changes that occurred in South America during the Cenozoic.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The observed synchronicity between planetary and biological events suggests that global change played a crucial role in shaping the evolutionary history of extant xenarthrans. Our findings open ways to test this hypothesis further in other South American mammalian endemics like hystricognath rodents, platyrrhine primates, and didelphid marsupials.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8518", "publicationDate": "2011-02-01", "dateAvailable": "2011-02-01", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8518", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Kingman's coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the effective population size as a function of time.  Major goals of demographic reconstruction include identifying driving factors of effective population size, and understanding the association between the effective population size and such factors.  Building upon Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible framework that incorporates time-varying covariates that exploit Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of effective population size trajectories.  To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models.  Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories.  Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics.  We apply our model to four examples.  We reconstruct the demographic history of raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak.  Next, we examine the effective population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns.  We compare the population history of the HIV-1 CRF02_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective of incidence rate.

The flowering of woody apple trees is relatively late because of its long juvenile phase that greatly affects the genetic improvement process of these plants. To better understand the molecular regulation of floral transition and flower development in red-fleshed apple, we isolated and characterized a floral MADS-box gene, MdAGL24-like, in this paper. MdAGL24-like shares sequence similarity with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) from other species. It\u2019s dynamically expressed in flowers, followed by roots and fruits. Like other transcript factors, MdAGL24-like was localized in the nucleus. MdAGL24-like could interact with MdSOC1 and MdAP1 in vivo and in vitro. MdAGL24-like and MdSOC1 could increase each other\u2019s expression by binding the CArG motifs in their promoters. Unlike MdSOC1, MdAGL24-like couldn\u2019t directly bind the downstream gene MdLFY. Ectopic overexpression of MdAGL24-like in wild-type Arabidopsis induced early flowering similar to the phenotypes induced by other AGL24 genes. Like AGL24 in Arabidopsis, MdAGL24-like could somewhat rescue the late-flowering phenotype of agl24. These results would clarify the molecular mechanism underlying flowering and provide a method of shortening the juvenile period in red-fleshed apples and other fruit trees.\nThe work described has not been submitted elsewhere for publication, in whole or in part.

The library is based on OpenFOAM and enhances the general-purpose LES solvers provided by this software with state-of-the-art wall modelling capability. The included wall models belong to the class of wall-stress models that account for the under-resolved turbulent structures by predicting and enforcing the correct local value of the wall shear stress. A review of this approach is given, followed by a detailed description of the library, discussing its functionality and extensible design. The included wall-stress models are presented, based on both algebraic and ordinary differential equations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the library, it was used for WMLES of turbulent channel flow and the flow over a backward-facing step (BFS). For each flow, a systematic simulation campaign was performed, in order to find a combination of numerical schemes, grid resolution and wall model type that would yield a good predictive accuracy for both the mean velocity field in the outer layer of the TBLs and the mean wall shear stress. The best result, ~1% error in the above quantities, was achieved for channel flow using a mildly dissipative second-order accurate scheme for the convective fluxes applied on an isotropic grid with 27000 cells per d^3-cube, where d is the channel half-height. In the case of flow over a BFS, this combination led to the best agreement with experimental data.

Further, five glioma molecular sub-groups were derived using three molecular alterations and included the sub-groups with: i) IDH mutations only, ii) IDH and TERTp mutation only, iii) IDH and 1p/19q co-deletion only, iv) Triple negative and v) Triple positive.  \nResults: IDH mutations and 1p/19q co-deletions were individually and significantly associated with an improved progression free (p=0.001 and p=0.002 respectively) and overall survival (p=0.000 and p=0.005 respectively) in the present cohort of gliomas. TERTp mutations occurred frequently in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (94%), oligodendrogliomas (87.5%) and glioblastomas (54%). Sub-division into molecular sub-groups showed that the triple positive tumors carried the best prognosis, followed by IDH only, triple negative and finally the TERTp mutation only tumors (p-value &lt;0.000). \nConclusion: This indicates that sub-classification using these molecular markers separates tumors into prognostically relevant categories.", "doi": "10.17632/mfrm9fbc7s.6", "publicationDate": "2020-04-04", "dateAvailable": "2020-04-04", "version": "6", "accessRights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/mfrm9fbc7s", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

We used nontargeted metabolite profiling to follow age-associated trajectories of &gt;15,000 metabolites in Drosophila subjected to control and lifespan-extending diets.  We find that aging is associated with increased metabolite diversity and low-abundance molecules, suggesting they include cumulative damage. Remarkably, the number of detected compounds leveled-off in late-life, and this pattern associated with survivorship.  Fourteen-percent of metabolites showed age-associated changes, which decelerated in late-life and long-lived flies.  In contrast, known metabolites changed in abundance similarly to nontargeted metabolites and transcripts, but did not increase in diversity.  Targeted profiling also revealed slower metabolism and accumulation of lifespan-limiting molecules.

Despite a low initial fitness, one ortholog reached a significantly higher fitness plateau than its counterparts, via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity.

This manuscript covers the development of nonlinear dynamic filters, termed \u201cinput-output (IO) models\u201d, to accurately reproduce non-linear synaptic dynamics but with improved computational efficiency.

To harness the full power of this single-molecule information, we use the Bayesian inference of EM (BioEM) formalism. By ranking structural models using posterior probabilities calculated for individual images, BioEM in principle addresses the challenge of working with highly dynamic or heterogeneous systems not easily handled in traditional EM reconstruction. However, the calculation of these posteriors for large numbers of particles and models is computationally demanding. Here we present highly parallelized, GPU-accelerated computer software that performs this task efficiently. Our flexible formulation employs CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI parallelization combined with both CPU and GPU computing. The resulting BioEM software scales nearly ideally both on pure CPU and on CPU+GPU architectures, thus enabling Bayesian analysis of tens of thousands of images in a reasonable time.

Here, we report measurements of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the density field of an insoluble surfactant driven by gravity\u2013capillary waves in a shallow cylindrical container. Standing Faraday waves and travelling waves generated by the meniscus are superimposed to create a non-trivial surfactant density field. We measure both the height field of the surface using moir\u00e9 imaging, and the density field of the surfactant via the fluorescence of NBD-tagged phosphatidylcholine, a lipid. Through phase averaging stroboscopically acquired images of the density field, we determine that the surfactant accumulates on the leading edge of the travelling meniscus waves and in the troughs of the standing Faraday waves. We fit the spatiotemporal variations in the two fields using an ansatz consisting of a superposition of Bessel functions, and report measurements of the wavenumbers and energy damping factors associated with the meniscus and Faraday waves, as well as the spatial and temporal phase shifts between them. While these measurements are largely consistent for both types of waves and both fields, it is notable that the damping factors for height and surfactant in the meniscus waves do not agree.

Data from 2 glass samples are concatenated, equally undersampled and used in 5-fold cross-validation training the ML models, whereas the remaining sample is set-aside for rigorous generalization tests. For Ni62Nb38, Al90Sm10 and Fe80P20 metallic glasses, we construct samples of 131072 atoms. The timestep is 1 fs.

The samples are annealed at 2000 K for 1 ns, quenched to 50 K with each quenching rate, and relaxed at 50 K for 1 ns. After quenching, the Cu-Zr MGs are compressed along Z axis under a strain rate of 2.5 \u00d7 10E7 s-1 in a quasi-static mode (constantly apply a small strain and then relax, up to the strain of 10%) at a low temperature of 50 K (see Supplementary Figure 3 for typical stress-strain curves). Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are imposed in Y and Z axes and free surfaces are applied along X axis to allow shear offsets.

In par- ticular, with the high precision of the observations of helioseismology, a high-quality solar model is mandated, since even the tiny deviations between a model and the real Sun can be detected. \u2767 One crucial ingredient of any solar model is the thermodynamics of hot-dense plasmas, in particular the equation of state. This has motivated efforts to develop sophisticated theoretical equations of state (EOS). It is important to realize that for the conditions of solar-interior plasmas, there are no terrestrial laboratory experiments; the only observational constraints come from helioseismology. Among the most successful EOS is so called OPAL EOS, which is part of the Opacity Project at Livermore. It is based on an activity expansion of the quantum plasma, and realized in the so-called \u201dphysical picture\u201d. One of its main competitor is the so called MHD EOS, which is part of the international Opacity Project (OP), a non-classified multi-country consortium. The approach of MHD is via the so-called \u201dchemical picture\u201d. Since OPAL is the most accurate equation of state so far, there has been a call for a public-domain version of it. However, the OPAL code remains proprietary, and its \u201cemulation\u201d makes sense. An additional reason for such a project is that the results form OPAL can only be accessed via tables generated by the OPAL team. Their users do not have the flexibility to change the chemical composition from their end. The earlier MHD-based OPAL emulator worked well with its modifica- tions of the MHD equation of state, which is the Planck-Larkin partition function and its corresponding scattering terms. With this modification, MHD can serve as a OPAL emula- tor with all the flexibility and accessibility. However, to build a really user-friendly OPAL emulator one should consider CEFF-based OPAL emulator. CEFF itself is already widely used practical EOS which can be easily implemented within any solar model code. \u2767 In the present work we have carried the technique of the MHD-based OPAL emulator to the CEFF-based OPAL emulator and successfully accomplished this goal. At the same time, we went beyond the earlier work by adding more terms. In particular, the previous MHD-based OPAL emulator was restricted to the approximation of a hydrogen plasma; our work is extended to the more realistic H-He mixture. \u2767 In a separate part of the present work, we have examined a non-equilibrium effect in the solar interior. The effect is located in the zone of the sharp transition between the differential rotation in the convection zone and the solid-sphere rotation in the radiation zone beneath it. This transition was discovered by helioseismology in the 1980s, and the transition zone is called the solar tachocline. The tachocline is subject to strong shear and in many theories of the solar dynamo it plays important role. Being inspired by the well-known Soret effect, which states the mass diffusion drive by a temperature gradient, we have examined if there could also be mass diffusion by a shear flow. If such an effect were to exist, it would have potential applications to the solar tachocline and dynamo. We have run a so-called reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulation. As a test, we first confirmed the Soret effect by the simulation, then we tested for a shear- driven analogous effect. As a result, we did not see the shear-driven Soret effect in our simulation. We do observe the normal Soret effect due to the temperature gradient caused by the numerical scheme we used.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-27826", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-27826", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Standing Faraday waves and travelling waves generated by the meniscus are superimposed to create a non-trivial surfactant density field. We measure both the height field of the surface using moir\u00e9 imaging, and the density field of the surfactant via the fluorescence of NBD-tagged phosphatidylcholine, a lipid. Through phase averaging stroboscopically acquired images of the density field, we determine that the surfactant accumulates on the leading edge of the travelling meniscus waves and in the troughs of the standing Faraday waves. We fit the spatiotemporal variations in the two fields using an ansatz consisting of a superposition of Bessel functions, and report measurements of the wavenumbers and energy damping factors associated with the meniscus and Faraday waves, as well as the spatial and temporal phase shifts between them. While these measurements are largely consistent for both types of waves and both fields, it is notable that the damping factors for height and surfactant in the meniscus waves do not agree.

Extensively available multicore clusters have influenced hybrid message-passing and multithreading parallel algorithms to become a standard parallelization for modern clusters. However, hybrid parallel applications of portable scalability on emerging high-end multicore clusters consisting of multimillion cores are yet to be accomplished. Achieving scalability on emerging multicore platforms is an enormous challenge, since we do not even know the architecture of future platforms, with new hardware features such as hardware transactional memory (HTM) constantly being deployed. Scalable implementation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on massively parallel computers has been one of the major driving forces of supercomputing technologies. Especially, recent advancements in reactive MD simulations based on many-body interatomic potentials have necessitated efficient dynamic n-tuple computation. Hence, it is of great significance now to develop scalable hybrid n-tuple computation algorithms to provide a viable foundation for high-performance parallel-computing software on forthcoming architectures. \u2767 This dissertation research develops a scalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading algorithm for n-tuple MD simulation, which will continue to scale on future architectures (i.e. achieving metascalability). The two major goals of this dissertation research are: (1) design a scalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading parallel algorithmic framework on multicore architectures and evaluate it on most advanced parallel architectures; and (2) develop a computation-pattern algebraic framework to design scalable algorithms for general n-tuple computation and prove its optimality in a systematic and mathematically rigorous manner. \u2767 To achieve the first goal, we have developed and thoroughly analyzed algorithms for hybrid message passing interface (MPI) + open multiprocessing (OpenMP) parallelization of n-tuple MD simulation, which are scalable on large multicore clusters. Two data-privatization thread scheduling algorithms via nucleation-growth allocation have been designed: (1) compact-volume allocation scheduling (CVAS); and (2) breadth-first allocation scheduling (BFAS). These two algorithms combine fine-grain dynamic load balancing and minimal memory-footprint threading. Theoretical study has revealed decent asymptotic memory efficiency for both algorithms, thereby reducing 75% memory consumption compared to a na\u00efve-threading algorithm. Furthermore, performance benchmarks have confirmed higher performance of the hybrid MD algorithm over a traditional algorithm on large multicore clusters, where 2.58-fold speedup of the hybrid algorithm over the traditional algorithm was observed on 32,768 nodes of IBM BlueGene/P. \u2767 We have also investigated the performance characteristics of HTM on the IBM BlueGene/Q computer in comparison with conventional concurrency control mechanisms, using an MD application as an example. Benchmark tests, along with overhead-cost and scalability analysis, have quantified relative performance advantages of HTM over other mechanisms. We found that the bookkeeping cost of HTM is high but that the rollback cost is low. We have proposed transaction fusion and spatially compact scheduling techniques to reduce the overhead of HTM with minimal programming. A strong scalability benchmark has shown that the fused HTM has the shortest runtime among various concurrency control mechanisms without extra memory. Based on the performance characterization, we have derived a decision tree in the concurrency-control design space for general multithreading applications. \u2767 To achieve the second goal, we have developed a computation-pattern algebraic framework to mathematically formulate general n-tuple computation. Based on translation/reflection-invariant properties of computation patterns within this framework, we have designed a shift-collapse (SC) algorithm for cell-based parallel MD. Theoretical analysis has quantified the compact n-tuple search space and small communication cost of SC-MD for arbitrary n, which are reduced to those in best pair-computation approaches (e.g. eighth-shell method) for n = 2. Benchmark tests have shown that SC-MD outperforms our production MD code at the finest grain, with 9.7- and 5.1-fold speedups on Intel-Xeon and BlueGene/Q clusters. SC-MD has also exhibited excellent strong scalability. \u2767 In addition, we have analyzed the computational and data-access patterns of MD, which led to the development of a performance prediction model for short-range pair-wise force computations in MD simulations. The analysis and performance model provide fundamental understanding of computation patterns and optimality of certain parameters in MD simulations, thus allowing scientists to determine the optimal cell dimension in a linked-list cell method. The model has accurately estimated the number of operations during the simulations with the maximum error of 10.6% compared to actual measurements. Analysis and benchmark of the model have revealed that the optimal cell dimension minimizing the computation time is determined by a trade-off between decreasing search space and increasing linked-list cell access for smaller cells. \u2767 One difficulty about MD is that it is a dynamic irregular application, which often suffers considerable performance deterioration during execution. To address this problem, an optimal data-reordering schedule has been developed for runtime memory-access optimization of MD simulations on parallel computers. Analysis of the memory-access penalty during MD simulations has shown that the performance improvement from computation and data reordering degrades gradually as data translation lookaside buffer misses increase. We have also found correlations between the performance degradation with physical properties such as the simulated temperature, as well as with computational parameters such as the spatial-decomposition granularity. Based on a performance model and pre-profiling of data fragmentation behaviors, we have developed an optimal runtime data-reordering schedule, thereby archiving speedup of 1.35, 1.36 and 1.28, respectively, for MD simulations of silica at temperatures 300 K, 3,000 K and 6,000 K. \u2767 The main contributions of this dissertation research are two-fold: Metascalable hybrid message-passing and multithreading parallel algorithmic framework on emerging multicore parallel clusters, and a novel computation-pattern algebraic framework to design scalable algorithm for general n-tuple computation and prove its optimality in a mathematically rigorous manner. We expect that the proposed hybrid algorithms and mathematical approaches will provide a generic framework to a broad range of applications on future extreme-scale computing platforms.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-309586", "publicationDate": "2013-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-309586", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

In groundwaters, large geographic ranges of presumably good dispersers are increasingly suspected to consist of assemblages of cryptic species with narrow ranges. Moreover, a large species range, even when confirmed by molecular evidence, tells us little about the spatiotemporal dynamics of dispersal. Here, we used phylogenetic inferences, species delineation methods and Bayesian phylogeographic diffusion models to test for the likelihood of postglacial colonization from distant refugia among five morphospecies of Proasellus (Isopoda, Asellidae). All morphospecies except one were monophyletic, but they comprised a total of 15\u201317 cryptic species. Three cryptic species retained ranges that spanned a distance &gt;650 km, similar to that of the nominal morphospecies. Bayesian diffusion models based on mitochondrial markers revealed considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in dispersal rates, suggesting that short-time dispersal windows were instrumental in shaping species ranges. Only one species was found to experience a recent, presumably postglacial, range expansion. The Jura and Alpine foothills probably played a major role in maintaining diversity within Proasellus in northern regions by acting both as diversification hotspots and Pleistocene refugia. Gaining insight into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of dispersal rates revealed contrasting colonization dynamics among species that were not consistent with a global postglacial colonization of Europe from distant refugia.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.fh472", "publicationDate": "2015-02-12", "dateAvailable": "2015-02-12", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fh472", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Intuitively, one might answer that it is, given that challenging locomotion externally (e.g. rough terrain) or internally (e.g. age-related impairments) makes our movements more unstable. Here, we investigated how young and old humans synergistically activate muscles during locomotion when different perturbation levels are introduced. Of these control signals, called muscle synergies, we analyzed the stability over time and the complexity (or irregularity). Surprisingly, we found that perturbations force the central nervous system to produce muscle activation patterns that are less unstable and less complex. These outcomes show that robust locomotion in challenging settings is achieved by producing less complex control signals which are more stable over time, whereas easier tasks allow for more unstable and irregular control.\n\nHow to use the data set\n\nThis supplementary data set contains: a) the metadata with anonymized participant information, b) the raw electromyographic (EMG) data acquired during locomotion, c) the touchdown and lift-off timings of the recorded limb, d) the filtered and time-normalized EMG, e) the muscle synergies extracted via non-negative matrix factorization and f) the code written in R (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) to process the data, including the scripts to calculate the short-term Maximum Lyapunov Exponents (sMLE) and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) of motor primitives. In total, 476 trials from 86 participants are included in the supplementary data set.\n\nThe file \u201cparticipant_data.dat\u201d is available in ASCII and RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format and contains:\n\n\n\tCode: the participant\u2019s code\n\tExperiment: the experimental setup in which the participant was involved (E1 = walking and running, overground and treadmill; E2 = walking and running, even- and uneven-surface; E3 = unperturbed and perturbed walking, young and old)\n\tGroup: the group to which the participant was assigned (see methods for the details)\n\tSex: the participant\u2019s sex (M or F)\n\tSpeed: the speed at which the recordings were conducted in [m/s] (two values separated by a comma mean that recordings were done at two different speeds, i.e. walking and running)\n\tAge: the participant\u2019s age in years (participants were considered old if older than 65 years, but younger than 80)\n\tHeight: the participant\u2019s height in [cm]\n\tMass: the participant\u2019s body mass in [kg].\n\n\nThe files containing the gait cycle breakdown are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the file named \u201cCYCLE_TIMES.RData\u201d. The files are structured as data frames with 30 rows (one for each gait cycle) and two columns. The first column contains the touchdown incremental times in seconds. The second column contains the duration of each stance phase in seconds. Each trial is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like \u201cCYCLE_TIMES_P0020,\u201d where the characters \u201cCYCLE_TIMES\u201d indicate that the trial contains the gait cycle breakdown times and the characters \u201cP0020\u201d indicate the participant number (in this example the 20th). Please note that the overground trials of participants P0001 and P0009 and the second uneven-surface running trial of participant P0048 only contain 22, 27 and 23 cycles, respectively.\n\nThe files containing the raw, filtered and the normalized EMG data are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the files named \u201cRAW_EMG.RData\u201d and \u201cFILT_EMG.RData\u201d. The raw EMG files are structured as data frames with 30000 rows (one for each recorded data point) and 14 columns. The first column contains the incremental time in seconds. The remaining thirteen columns contain the raw EMG data, named with muscle abbreviations that follow those reported in the methods section. Each trial is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like \u201cRAW_EMG_P0053_OW_02\u201d, where the characters \u201cRAW_EMG\u201d indicate that the trial contains raw emg data, the characters \u201cP0053\u201d indicate the participant number (in this example the 53rd), the characters \u201cOW\u201d indicate the locomotion type (E1: OW=overground walking, OR=overground running, TW=treadmill walking, TR=treadmill running; E2: EW=even-surface walking, ER=even-surface running, UW=uneven-surface walking, UR=uneven-surface running; E3: NW=normal walking, PW=perturbed walking), and the numbers \u201c02\u201d indicate the trial number (in this case the 2nd). The 10 trials per participant recorded for each overground session (i.e. 10 for walking and 10 for running) were concatenated into one. The filtered and time-normalized EMG data is named, following the same rules, like \u201cFILT_EMG_P0053_OG_02\u201d.\n\nThe files containing the muscle synergies extracted from the filtered and normalized EMG data are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the files named \u201cSYNS_H.RData\u201d and \u201cSYNS_W.RData\u201d. The muscle synergies files are divided in motor primitives and motor modules and are presented as direct output of the factorization and not in any functional order. Motor primitives are data frames with 6000 rows and a number of columns equal to the number of synergies (which might differ from trial to trial) plus one. The rows contain the time-dependent coefficients (motor primitives), one column for each synergy plus the time points (columns are named e.g. \u201cTime, Syn1, Syn2, Syn3\u201d, where \u201cSyn\u201d is the abbreviation for \u201csynergy\u201d). Each gait cycle contains 200 data points, 100 for the stance and 100 for the swing phase which, multiplied by the 30 recorded cycles, result in 6000 data points distributed in as many rows. This output is transposed as compared to the one discussed above to improve user readability. Each set of motor primitives is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like \u201cSYNS_H_P0012_PW_02\u201d, where the characters \u201cSYNS_H\u201d indicate that the trial contains motor primitive data, the characters \u201cP0012\u201d indicate the participant number (in this example the 12th), ), the characters \u201cPW\u201d indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers \u201c02\u201d indicate the trial number (in this case the 2nd). Motor modules are data frames with 13 rows (number of recorded muscles) and a number of columns equal to the number of synergies (which might differ from trial to trial). The rows, named with muscle abbreviations that follow those reported in the methods section, contain the time-independent coefficients (motor modules), one for each synergy and for each muscle. Each set of motor modules relative to one synergy is saved as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like \u201cSYNS_W_P0082_PW_02\u201d, where the characters \u201cSYNS_W\u201d indicate that the trial contains motor module data, the characters \u201cP0082\u201d indicate the participant number (in this example the 82nd) ), the characters \u201cPW\u201d indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers \u201c02\u201d indicate the trial number (in this case the 2nd). Given the nature of the NMF algorithm for the extraction of muscle synergies, the supplementary data set might show non-significant differences as compared to the one used for obtaining the results of this paper.\n\nThe files containing the sMLE calculated from motor primitives are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the file named \u201csMLE.RData\u201d. sMLE results are presented in a list of lists containing, for each trial, 1) the divergences, 2) the sMLE, and 3) the value of the R2 between the divergence curve and its linear interpolation made using the specified amount of points. The divergences are presented as a one-dimensional vector. sMLE are one number like the R2 value. Trials are named like \u201cMLE_P0081_EW_01\u201d, where the characters \u201csMLE\u201d indicate that the trial containss sMLE data, the characters \u201cP0081\u201d indicate the participant number (in this example the 81st) ), the characters \u201cEW\u201d indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers \u201c01\u201d indicate the trial number (in this case the 1st).\n\nThe files containing the HFD calculated from motor primitives are available in RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format, in the file named \u201cHFD.RData\u201d. HFD results are presented in a list of lists containing, for each trial, 1) the HFD, and 2) the interval time k used for the calculations. HFDs are presented as one number, as are the interval times k. Trials are named like \u201cHFD_P0048_TR_01\u201d, where the characters \u201cHFD\u201d indicate that the trial contains HFD data, the characters \u201cP0048\u201d indicate the participant number (in this example the 48th), the characters \u201cTR\u201d indicate the locomotion type (see above), and the numbers \u201c01\u201d indicate the trial number (in this case the 1st).\n\nAll the code used for the preprocessing of EMG data, the extraction of muscle synergies, the calculation of sMLE and HFD is available in R (R Found. for Stat.

Explanatory comments are profusely present throughout the scripts (\u201cSYNS.R\u201d, which is the script to extract synergies, \u201cfun_NMF.R\u201d, which contains the NMF function, \u201csMLE.R\u201d, which is the script to calculate the sMLE of motor primitives, \u201cHFD.R\u201d, which is the script to calculate the HFD of motor primitives, \u201cfun_sMLE.R\u201d, which contains the sMLE function and \u201cfun_HFD.R\u201d, which contains the HFD function).", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.3408736", "publicationDate": "2019-09-16", "dateAvailable": "2019-09-16", "version": null, "accessRights": "info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess", "containerURI": "https://zenodo.org/record/3408736", "method": null, "source": "ZENODO", "type_cont": "article"},

Here we focus on the long-term study describing metapopulation dynamics of an obligate pathogen, the powdery mildew (Podosphaera plantaginis) naturally infecting its wild host plant (Plantago lanceolata) in the fragmented landscape of the \u00c5land archipelago (southwest Finland). Regionally, the pathogen persists through a balance of extinctions and colonizations, yet factors affecting extinction rates remain poorly understood. Mycoparasites of the genus Ampelomyces appear as good candidates for testing the role of a hyperparasite, i.e. a parasite of other parasites, in the regulation of their fungal hosts\u2019 population dynamics. For this purpose, we first designed a quantitative PCR assay for detection of Ampelomyces spp. in field-collected samples. This newly developed molecular test was then applied to a large-scale sampling within the \u00c5land archipelago, revealing that Ampelomyces is a widespread hyperparasite in this system, with high variability in prevalence among populations. We found that the hyperparasite was more common on leaves where multiple powdery mildew strains coexist, a pattern that may be attributed to differential exposure. Moreover, the prevalence of Ampelomyces at the plant level negatively affected the overwinter survival of its fungal host. We conclude that this hyperparasite may likely impact on its host population dynamics and argue for increased focus on the role of hyperparasites in disease dynamics.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.mv332", "publicationDate": "2014-09-04", "dateAvailable": "2014-09-04", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.mv332", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The geographical location of multiple hotspot populations indicates that multiple invasions have occurred in Nova Scotia. A loss of genetic diversity from port to marina populations suggests a stronger influence of ships than recreational boats on primary coastal introductions. Population similarity analysis reveals a clear dependence of marina populations on those that had been previously established in ports and connectivity due to a boating network better explains patterns in population similarities than does natural spread.

However, traditional field studies of extinction\u2013colonization are potentially fraught with detection bias and have rarely been validated. Here, we provide a comparison of molecular and field-based approaches for assessment of the extinction\u2013colonization dynamics of tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) in northern California. Our analysis of temporal genetic variation across 14 northern California tidewater goby populations failed to recover genetic change expected with extinction\u2013colonization cycles. Similarly, analysis of site occupancy data from field studies (94 sites) indicated that extinction and colonization are very infrequent for our study populations. Comparison of the approaches indicated field data were subject to imperfect detection, and falsely implied extinction\u2013colonization cycles in several instances. For northern California populations of tidewater goby, we interpret the strong genetic differentiation between populations and high degree of within-site temporal stability as consistent with a model of drift in the absence of migration, at least over the past 20\u201330 years. Our findings show that tidewater goby exhibit different population structures across their geographic range (extinction\u2013colonization dynamics in the south vs. drift in isolation in the north). For northern populations, natural dispersal is too infrequent to be considered a viable approach for recolonizing extirpated populations, suggesting that species recovery will likely depend on artificial translocation in this region.

The computational challenges include suboptimal predictions of solubility and rate of solution, which are important for prediction of pharmacokinetics; and neglect of solvation during prediction of binding (docking), which undermines the reliability of the outcomes. As an example, the work will focus on curcumin, a medicinally interesting molecule, but one that requires modification for practical use as a potential drug. The pharmacological effects of curcumin are a result of a synergism of networks of weak biochemical interactions with multiple biological targets in interrelated signaling pathways, which include: antiinflammatory, antioxidant, chemopreventive, anticancer, and antimicrobial effects. These effects have been examined in clinical trials that concluded that high doses of curcumin at the level of grams are required to obtain therapeutic effects. This is because the potential clinical efficacy of curcumin is limited by its physicochemical properties of poor water solubility and instability, which result in low bioavailability. Prodrugs of curcumin offer an approach to improvement of the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties, and may allow exploitation of the pharmacological effects of curcumin. The hypothesis in this work is that computational approaches can be used to understand and predict properties of curcumin and curcumin prodrugs that influence their oral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This will be assessed through building of models to (1) predict pharmacokinetic properties; and (2) predict affinity and properties of binding with consideration of water environment contributions in each binding event. These models and protocols are executed using in-house algorithms (WATGEN and NASDAC) and commercial programs (GastroPlus\u2122, NAMD, Autodock Vina), with validation based on experimental data collected from literature. \u2767 First the results showed that using our protocol and our new pharmacokinetics model of prodrugs we were able to reproduce experimental findings of the plasma concentration profile of curcumin, when administered either as curcumin or as a prodrug, curcumin diethyldisuccinate. By applying the same protocol and model to curcumin diglutaric acid we found that this prodrug releases curcumin in vivo with an estimated 25-folds increase in Cmax (&gt; 4.5 ng/ml), tmax 1.5 h and t1/2 2.5 h. These findings suggest that curcumin diglutaric acid improves the pharmacokinetic properties of curcumin. This work required evaluation of the predictions of solubility and rate of solution of many drugs and showed that these predictions are still suboptimal. Predictions based on 2D structural information may be insufficient in the drug discovery arena. \u2767 Second, we predicted the affinity and binding properties of curcumin and curcumin diethyldisuccinate with B-DNA, with consideration of the contributions of water molecules in the binding interface. The results were compared to a positive control (netropsin). The results showed that the order of theoretical affinity was curcumin &lt; curcumin diethyldisuccinate &lt; netropsin, and only netropsin was able to displace all water molecules from the minor groove. Curcumin lacks this ability due to its planarity which minimize its isoheliciy with the minor groove. Curcumin diethyldisuccinate has the same structural feature of planarity of curcumin, which limits its ability to displace all water molecules from the minor groove. Thus, 3D conformations contribute to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of medicinal molecules such as curcumin. In solution, conformation is most relevant to biological activity since it controls recognition and selectivity components. Herein we used molecular dynamics to predict in solution conformers of curcumin and its derivatives. \u2767 Lastly, the models developed for curcumin are likely to be extendable to other drug candidates. We used our protocols to expedite the drug discovery process of a series of new sesquiterpenes designed to target COX2 to improve sensitivity of tumor cells toward photodynamic therapy by inhibition of COX2 expression and activity. Our protocol aided in identification of a lead compound (number 9). In conclusion, computational methodology can be used to understand and predict properties that influence oral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medicinally interesting molecules.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-415454", "publicationDate": "2017-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-415454", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

A total of 874 individuals (~30 per population) from 5 ports and 21 marinas was collected and analyzed using both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and 10 nuclear microsatellite markers. The geographical location of multiple hotspot populations indicates that multiple invasions have occurred in Nova Scotia. A loss of genetic diversity from port to marina populations suggests a stronger influence of ships than recreational boats on primary coastal introductions. Population similarity analysis reveals a clear dependence of marina populations on those that had been previously established in ports and connectivity due to a boating network better explains patterns in population similarities than does natural spread.

Here we focus on the long-term study describing metapopulation dynamics of an obligate pathogen, the powdery mildew (Podosphaera plantaginis) naturally infecting its wild host plant (Plantago lanceolata) in the fragmented landscape of the \u00c5land archipelago (southwest Finland). Regionally, the pathogen persists through a balance of extinctions and colonizations, yet factors affecting extinction rates remain poorly understood. Mycoparasites of the genus Ampelomyces appear as good candidates for testing the role of a hyperparasite, i.e. a parasite of other parasites, in the regulation of their fungal hosts\u2019 population dynamics. For this purpose, we first designed a quantitative PCR assay for detection of Ampelomyces spp. in field-collected samples. This newly developed molecular test was then applied to a large-scale sampling within the \u00c5land archipelago, revealing that Ampelomyces is a widespread hyperparasite in this system, with high variability in prevalence among populations. We found that the hyperparasite was more common on leaves where multiple powdery mildew strains coexist, a pattern that may be attributed to differential exposure. Moreover, the prevalence of Ampelomyces at the plant level negatively affected the overwinter survival of its fungal host.

Western blots showed inhibition of FGFR2 by TUSC2 transient transfection, and marked increase of PARP, an apoptotic marker, cleavage level after TUSC2-erlotinb combined treatment. Suppression of FGFR2 by AZD4547 or gene knockdown enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib in some but not all tested cell lines.

We capitalized on methods commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the structure of community interaction matrices, so called \u2018bipartite networks\u2019, reflected observed coevolutionary dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race coevolutionary dynamics and the other fluctuating coevolutionary dynamics. Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary time, but we found no evidence for a trade off with impact on bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor, while bacteria coevolving with the fluctuating selection phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions of the pilF gene associated with Type IV pili.

We explore the convergence of the method as a function of the simulation cell size, and note the significance of taking into account the elastic correction in the limit where the size of the defect is comparable with the size of the simulation cell.", "doi": "10.17632/3h6xffk9h6.1", "publicationDate": "2020-01-16", "dateAvailable": "2020-01-16", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3h6xffk9h6", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

To understand how microorganisms coordinate a dynamic response to changes in zinc availability at the molecular level, we evaluated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein at each of the known Zur-regulated genes in Escherichia coli. We solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and show that this metalloregulatory protein represses gene expression by a highly cooperative binding of two adjacent dimers to essentially encircle the core element of each of the Zur-regulated promoters. Cooperativity in these protein-DNA interactions requires a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49\u2032 that connect otherwise independent dimers. Analysis of the protein-DNA interface led to the discovery of a new member of the Zur-regulon: pliG. We demonstrate this gene is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc responsive manner. The pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur regulon promoters. Comparison of the in vitro Zur-DNA binding affinity at each of four Zur-regulon promoters reveals ca. 10,000-fold variation Zur-DNA binding constants. The degree of Zur repression observed in vivo by comparison of transcript copy number in wild-type and \u0394zur strains parallels this trend spanning a 100-fold difference. We conclude that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly and that the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.vn6dv", "publicationDate": "2014-11-21", "dateAvailable": "2014-11-21", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vn6dv", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

To determine the extent by which absolute TF concentration dictates gene expression and morphogenesis programs that ultimately lead to patterns in Drosophila embryos, we manipulate maternally supplied patterning determinants and measure readout concentration at the position of various developmental markers. When we increase the overall amount of the maternal TF Bicoid 5-fold, Bicoid concentrations in cells at positions of the cephalic furrow, an early morphological marker, differ by a factor of two. This finding apparently contradicts the traditional threshold-dependent readout model, which predicts that the Bicoid concentrations at these positions should be identical. In contrast, Bicoid concentration at target gene expression boundaries is nearly unchanged during early developmental times, but adjusts dynamically toward the same 2-fold change as development progresses. Thus the Drosophila segmentation gene network responds faithfully to Bicoid concentration during early development, in agreement with the threshold model, but subsequently partially adapts in response to altered Bicoid dosage, driving segmentation patterns towards their wild-type positions. This dynamic response requires other maternal regulators such as Torso and Nanos, suggesting that integration of maternal input information is not achieved through molecular interactions at the time of readout, but through the subsequent collective interplay of the network.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.2j9p4", "publicationDate": "2013-04-12", "dateAvailable": "2013-04-12", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2j9p4", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

GAD is found in the brain and substantial\namounts of GAD65 and GAD67 are also found in the !-islet cells of the pancreas, epithelial\ncells of oviduct and spermatocytes in the testes. The 67 kDa isoform, GAD67, is\nconstitutively active and produces &gt;90% of GABA in the central nervous system, whereas\nGAD65 is transiently activated to produce GABA in response to a sudden increase in demand.\nAccording to their linear sequence, the first 100 amino acids in the two isoforms differ\nsubstantially, but the isoforms show 74% sequence identity within the middle and the Cterminal\ndomain. The association and dissociation of PLP plays an important role in the\nregulatory function of the GAD enzymes and GAD65 exists predominantly as an apoenzyme\n(no PLP attached in the enzyme catalytic site), but GAD67 exists predominantly in its active\nholoform. There are structural differences between the apo- and holo-forms of the enzyme.\nAntibodies to GAD65 (anti-GAD65) occur frequently in type 1 diabetes (T1D) but GAD67\nis rarely autoantigenic in T1D and these antibodies (anti-GAD67) may represent a cross\nreactive population of anti-GAD65. The recently elucidated crystal structures of GAD65 and\nGAD67, N-terminally truncated by 87 (GAD65) or 92 (GAD67) amino acids revealed\nflexible disordered regions at the C termini on GAD65 but not in GAD67, and B-cell epitopes\nfor various human monoclonal antibodies (hmAb) are located on the flexible regions of\nGAD65.\nThe hypothesis for this work is that differences in the two isoforms in structural\nflexibility, or structural changes resulting from interaction with the PLP co-factor\nprovide the basis for the difference in autoantigenicity of the GAD isoforms.\nBased on the hypothesis the project is designed to have three different aims;\n1. To confirm that GAD65 is the major autoantigen in T1D, and that anti-GAD67\nrepresents a cross-reactive subset of anti-GAD65.\n2. To design mutants of GAD65 to stabilize the C-terminal domain of GAD65, and to\ncompare their reactivity with T1D sera with that of wild type GAD65.\n3. To use computational modelling and computational docking to compare the\nreactivities of the hMabs b96.11 and b78 with apo- and holo-GAD.\nThe levels, frequency, affinity and nature of cross reactivity of anti-GAD67 in sera from\npatients with T1D or LADA, that contained anti-GAD65 were measured by\nradioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) using 125I-labeled recombinant GAD65 and GAD67. For\neach antibody population, the specificity of the binding was measured by incubation with\n100-fold excess of unlabeled GAD in homologous and heterologous inhibition assays, and the\naffinity of binding with GAD65 and GAD67 was measured in selected sera. Sera were also\ntested for reactivity to GAD65 and GAD67 by immunoblotting. Of the 85 sera that contained\nanti-GAD65, 28 contained anti\u2013GAD67 measured by RIP. Inhibition with unlabeled GAD65\nsubstantially or completely reduced antibody reactivity with both 125I GAD65 and with 125I\nGAD67. In contrast, unlabeled GAD67 reduced autoantibody reactivity with 125I GAD67 but\nnot with 125I GAD65. Both populations of antibodies were of high affinity. Immunoblotting\nexperiment indicated that the epitopes for anti-GAD67 are conformational, like that of anti-\nGAD65. Competitive inhibition assay results suggest that for most sera anti-GAD67\nrepresents a minor population of anti-GAD65 reactive with an epitope shared between\nGAD65 and GAD67. So our findings lead to the conclusion that the anti-GAD67 represents\na cross reactive population of anti-GAD65.\nThe effect of flexibility on the autoantigenicity of holo-GAD65 was tested using a\ncombination of molecular dynamic simulation and mutagenesis techniques. Mutants were\ndesigned based on molecular dynamic simulations performed on the wild type GAD isoforms\nGAD65 and GAD67. These simulations predicted a flexible \u03b1\u2013helix 14 on GAD65 in the Cterminal\ndomain. Potential amino acid residues in and around the \u03b1\u2013helix 14 which could be\nthe main cause for the flexibility were identified. Two single mutants (GAD65H432A and\nGAD65P531A) and two double mutants in which the C-terminus was stabilized by disulphide\nbonds (GAD65H432C_P531C and GAD65I509C_V529C), were tested for structural and functional\nstability by CD spectroscopy and GAD enzyme assay, and tested for reactivity with anti-\nGAD65 in sera by RIP. All the four mutants of GAD65 along with the wild type GAD65 and\nGAD67 were tested for conformational changes and thermal stability using circular dichroism\non a Jasco J-815 spectrometer equipped with a Jasco Petlier type temperature controller\n(JASCO CDF-426S/15). The mutants GAD65H432A, GAD65H432C_P531C and GAD65I509C_V529C\nwere expressed and purified similarly to WT-GAD65 and showed similar conformations to\nWT-GAD65. The mutants retained the same fold and secondary structure composition as that for the native WT GAD65 with the expected increased conformational stability, measured as\nincreased thermal melting temperatures (Tm) on CD spectroscopy, and enzyme activity\nmeasurements showed that each retained some activity under the reducing conditions of the\nassay. Nonetheless, anti-GAD65 reactivity by RIP with each of the mutants was substantially\nor completely lost. The fourth mutant GAD65P531A expressed poorly, lacked enzymatic\nactivity and reactivity by RIP, and was thought to be miss-folded. Taken together these\nresults indicate that C-terminal flexibility is an important component of the antigenicity of\nGAD65.\nThe flexibility of GAD65 could include changes in structure between holo- and apo-\nGAD65, and the recent publication of a crystal structure for the apo- form of the related PLPdependent\ndecarboxylase, dopa-decarboxylase, DDC, has provided the opportunity to develop\nan homology model for apo-GAD65. To determine whether structural changes during\nbinding of PLP are likely to affect antigenicity computational docking was used to compare\nthe reactivity of human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) b78 and b96.11 with holo- and apo-\nGAD65. Homology models of Fv b78 and Fv b96.11 were docked to structures of holo-\nGAD65 and modelled apo-GAD65 using the rigid-body docking program ZDOCK, followed\nby refinement with RDOCK. The 30 most favourable complexes from RDOCK and 10 most\nfavourable from ZDOCK were further analysed based on previously published mutagenesis\ndata and antibody CDR interactions. For comparison, the reactivity of the two mAbs and sera\nfrom 14 patients with diabetes were also tested by RIP with GAD65 in the presence of PLP\n(holo-GAD65), or 5mM glutamate (apo-GAD65). For each mAb, b78 and b96.11, docking\npredicted epitope locations on both holo-GAD65 and apo-GAD65, but there were differences.\nFor b78, on holo-GAD65 the most favourable epitope region predicted included C-terminal and catalytic loop residues, consistent with its enzyme inhibitory nature. On apo-GAD65, the\nmost favourable complexes involved interactions of three or four acidic C-terminal residues\nwith basic residues in CDR L1 and CDR L2. More extensive interactions were rare, but were\nsimilar to those on holo-GAD65, suggesting that two-stage antibody docking could occur\nwith apo-GAD65, initially involving a few strong interactions, followed by more complex\ninteractions occurring with main chain movements and induced fit. For b96.11, interactions\nwere similar with both holo- and apo-GAD65 and involved docking a hydrophobic knob\nwithin a pocket on GAD65. RIP results showed that anti-GAD65 reactivity of diabetes sera,\nor of the mAbs b78 and b96.11, is not affected by the presence or absence of co-factor PLP in\nthe active site of GAD65.\nThese results provide strong evidence that GAD65 is the autoantigenic isoform in T1D, and\nthat anti-GAD67 results from the presence of a minor population of cross-reactive\nautoantibodies. The structural basis for the antigenicity of GAD65 can be related to\nflexibility in the C-terminal domain and the adjacent catalytic loop that is associated with the\nautoinactivation of GAD65 and formation of apo-GAD65 during enzymatic activity.\nNonetheless, the formation of apo-GAD65 does not apparently alter the antigenicity of\nGAD65, and it is likely that the flexibility in the C-terminal domain is retained in the apo-\nGAD. Flexibility of antigen and/or antibody is frequently required for strong antibody\nbinding, and this study suggests that it plays a major part in the development of an\nautoimmune response to GAD65 in T1D. It is notable that many autoantigens in autoimmune\ndiseases are enzymes, and that autoantibodies to these enzymes are frequently strongly\nenzyme inhibitory, and bind within the catalytic domain, a region in an enzyme which is\nlikely to be the most mobile. A requirement for flexibility and mobility for antigenicity could\nexplain the development of such autoimmune responses.", "doi": "10.4225/03/58b3a56a8d844", "publicationDate": "2017-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "In Copyright", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.4225%2F03%2F58b3a56a8d844", "method": null, "source": "ands.centre-3", "type_cont": null},

This may be due to the small size of the stock market relative to economy.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2007.2062", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2007.2062", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

Moreover, we have reported that many of these are in a SUMO-conjugated form when bound to a pre-mRNA substrate during a splicing reaction. We demonstrated that SUMOylation of Prp3 (PRPF3), a component of the U4/U6 di-snRNP, is required for U4/U6\u2022U5 tri-snRNP formation and/or recruitment to active spliceosomes. Expanding upon our previous results, we have shown that the splicing factor SRSF1 stimulates SUMO conjugation to several spliceosomal proteins. Given the relevance of the splicing process, as well as the complex and dynamic nature of its governing machinery, the spliceosome, the molecular mechanisms that modulate its function represent an attractive topic of research. We posit that SUMO conjugation could represent a way of modulating spliceosome assembly and thus, splicing efficiency. How cycles of SUMOylation/de-SUMOylation of spliceosomal proteins become integrated throughout the highly choreographed spliceosomal cycle awaits further investigation.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.6236549.v1", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.6236549.v1", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

The 140-residue alpha-synuclein plays a central role in the molecular chain of events leading to Parkinson' s disease. Alpha-synuclein is dynamically unstructured in aqueous solution, but readily binds to negatively charged membranes and micelles. Seven degenerate 11-residue repeats located within the first 89 amino acid residues confer membrane binding in an alpha-helical conformation. In this research, the structure of a pseudorepeat shuffled alpha-synuclein variant is characterized by NMR spectroscopy and is compared to the wild-type protein. It is shown that residues 30 to 40 become more rigid than the corresponding wild-type segment. Moreover, in contrast to the wild type, which prefers to adopt two anti-parallel helices, the shuffled variant prefers to adopt a single helix.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1299", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1299", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Stem cells in the feather have recently been mapped. However different parts of the chicken body have different size feathers. How stem cells are managed differently in these different feathers has not been elucidated. Here we analyze the growth pattern of feathers from neck and saddle feather. We analyze the topological arrangement of stem cell, TA cell, differentiated cell during different regenerative feather cycling. We found the stem cell is in a ring configuration during growth phase but shifted down to smaller ring or to assume a Ushape flanking the dermal papilla. The number of stem cells remains rather constant during stem cell cycling but also changes around three folds. On the contrast the number of TA cells change up to twenty thirty fold differences. There also appear to have higher stem cell number and a larger dermal papilla in the saddle compared to the neck feather. We found N-CAM and Tenascin-C expressed in the niche next to the stem cells. We also found TGF-beta2 enriched in the stem cells in the resting phase of the dermal papilla. This work suggests there is a dramatic shifting of stem cell topology during feather cycling, probably to accommodate the different homeotic relationship between stem, TA and differentiated cells. The dynamic changes of molecules also refract the dynamic changes of the microenvironment in the stem cell niche. Further investigation would be required to understand their molecular mechanism and regulation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1902", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1902", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The regions determining sexual identity are particularly dynamic parts of eukaryotic genomes that are prone to molecular degeneration associated with suppressed recombination. In the fungus Neurospora tetrasperma, it has been proposed that this molecular degeneration is counteracted by the introgression of non-degenerated DNA from closely related species. In this study, we used comparative and population genomic analyses of variation among 92 genomes from eight phylogenetically and reproductively isolated lineages of N. tetrasperma, and its three closest relatives, to investigate the factors shaping the evolutionary history of the genomes. We found that suppressed recombination extends across at least 6 Mbp (~63%) of the mating-type (mat) chromosome in N. tetrasperma, and is associated with decreased genetic diversity, which is likely the result primarily of selection at linked sites. Furthermore, analyses of molecular evolution revealed an increased mutational load in this region, relative to recombining regions. However, comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the mat chromosomes are temporarily regenerated via introgression from sister species; six out of eight lineages show introgression into one of their mat chromosomes, with at least three other Neurospora species acting as donors. The introgressed tracts have been driven to fixation in lineages, suggesting that they confer an adaptive advantage in natural populations, and our analyses support the presence of selective sweeps in at least one of the lineages. Thus, these data strongly support the previously hypothesized role of introgression as a mechanism for the maintenance of mating-type determining chromosomal regions.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.162mh", "publicationDate": "2016-02-17", "dateAvailable": "2016-02-17", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.162mh", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Journal of Neurophysiology. doi: 10.1152/jn.00342.2017\n\n\nDescription:\n\n\nSpeed discrimination\n\n\nIn the speed discrimination task, the subject was presented with a standard stimulus and a comparison stimulus (each 2 s long with a break of 500 ms in between). The standard stimulus was always presented first at a speed of either 3, 5 or 7 arbitrary units (AU)/s. The comparison stimulus was chosen from a range of +- 2 AU/s around the speed of the standard stimulus. After both stimuli had been presented, subjects had to indicate which one was perceived as faster by pressing one of two buttons. The combination of three standard speeds and two modality conditions resulted in 6 experimental conditions. In each condition 41 trials were performed that covered the given range of +- 2 AU/s in equidistant steps of 0.1 AU/s. In this discrimination task, each experimental condition was presented only once. The trials were conducted in a pseudo-randomized order.\n\n\nDistance reproduction\n\n\nIn the first experiment, we tested the ability of the subjects to reproduce a previously passively observed traveled distance using visual, tactile or bi-modal feedback. The subject was presented with a simulation of self-motion over a certain distance. The speeds during this presentation were always constant at 4 or 7 AU/s and the distances were either 5, 10 or 15 AU. In this first phase the stimulation was always bi-modal. After this presentation and a brief pause of 500 ms the task of the subject was to reproduce the passively observed distance using a joystick. In this second part either only the visual information, only the tactile information, or both modalities were available. The order of all conditions was pseudo-random.\n\n\nRe-scaling of tactile information\n\n\nIn the second experiment we investigated the effect of re-scaling of tactile information on the reproduced traveled distance. All simulated self-motion was bi-modal. The subjects were passively observing a simulated self-motion over a certain distance. The speed of this motion was not constant but had a sinusoidal profile with a peak speed at either 5 or 7 AU/s. The traveled distances were either 10, 15 or 20 AU. After the first presented distance and a brief gap of 500 ms another distance was presented passively. The speed profile of this second movement consisted of three different speeds between 3 AU/s and 10 AU/s. The distance covered by this second passive movement was always one third of the first passive distance but the subjects were neither informed about nor aware of this relationship. After the second presentation had stopped, the task of the subjects was to actively reproduce the first observed distance as a sum of the second passively observed distance and the subsequent active motion. In random 10% of the trials the tactile component of the motion was scaled up by 25% and in another 10% of the trials it was down-scaled by 25%. This means that the speed of the air flow on these trials was 25% faster (or slower) than in the rest of the trials. The re-scaling was applied only during the second passive motion and the active reproduction part of each trial. The subjects were not informed about and were not aware of this manipulation.\n\n\nThe experiments on distance reproduction and tactile rescaling were performed in two variations that differed in the relationship between the speed of the tactile stimulus and the speed of self-motion. While in the congruent condition the speed of the air flow was directly proportional to the speed of visual self-motion, in the incongruent condition the relation of the two measures was inversely proportional. The congruent and the incongruent configurations were always used in both, the presentation as well as in the reproduction phase of a trial. Importantly, a purely visual stimulation used in the two conditions was identical in both cases.

Gathering dietary data from predatory species, such as insectivorous bats, often presents logistical challenges, further exacerbated in biodiversity hot spots because prey items are highly speciose, yet their taxonomy is largely undescribed. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and bioinformatic analyses to phylogenetically group DNA sequences into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) to examine predator\u2013prey dynamics of three sympatric insectivorous bat species in the biodiversity hotspot of south-western Australia. We could only assign between 4% and 20% of MOTUs to known genera or species, depending on the method used, underscoring the importance of examining dietary diversity irrespective of taxonomic knowledge in areas lacking a comprehensive genetic reference database. MOTU analysis confirmed that resource partitioning occurred, with dietary divergence positively related to the ecomorphological divergence of the three bat species. We predicted that bat species' diets would converge during times of high energetic requirements, that is, the maternity season for females and the mating season for males. There was an interactive effect of season on female, but not male, bat species' diets, although small sample sizes may have limited our findings. Contrary to our predictions, females of two ecomorphologically similar species showed dietary convergence during the mating season rather than the maternity season. HTS-based approaches can help elucidate complex predator\u2013prey relationships in highly speciose regions, which should facilitate the conservation of biodiversity in genetically uncharacterized areas, such as biodiversity hotspots.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.km6ph", "publicationDate": "2013-09-18", "dateAvailable": "2013-09-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.km6ph", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

While recent technological advancements have deepened our understanding of metabolic and evolutionary features of the symbiont genomes, molecular mechanisms underpinning the intimate interactions remain difficult to approach because the insect symbionts are generally uncultivable. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris is associated with the betaproteobacterial Burkholderia symbiont in a posterior region of the midgut, which develops numerous crypts harbouring the symbiont extracellularly. Distinct from other insect symbiotic systems, R. pedestris acquires the Burkholderia symbiont not by vertical transmission but from the environment every generation. By making use of the cultivability and the genetic tractability of the symbiont, we constructed a transgenic Burkholderia strain labelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which enabled detailed observation of spatiotemporal dynamics and the colonization process of the symbiont in freshly prepared specimens. The symbiont live imaging revealed that, at the second instar, colonization of the symbiotic midgut M4 region started around 6 h after inoculation (hai). By 24 hai, the symbiont cells appeared in the main tract and also in several crypts of the M4. By 48 hai, most of the crypts were colonized by the symbiont cells. By 72 hai, all the crypts were filled up with the symbiont cells and the symbiont localization pattern continued during the subsequent nymphal development. Quantitative PCR of the symbiont confirmed the infection dynamics quantitatively. These results highlight the stinkbug-Burkholderia gut symbiosis as an unprecedented model for comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning insect symbiosis.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.q1r19", "publicationDate": "2013-07-26", "dateAvailable": "2013-07-26", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q1r19", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Being dependent on finding a host plant for growth, parasitic plants penetrate their host using specialized organs called haustoria. Haustoria establish vascular connections with the host, which enable the parasite to steal nutrients and water. The underlying molecular and developmental basis of parasitism by plants is largely unknown. In order to investigate the process of parasitism, RNAs from different stages, i.e. seed, seedling, vegetative strand, prehaustoria, haustoria, and flowers, were used to de-novo assemble and annotate the transcriptome of the obligate plant stem parasite Cuscuta pentagona (dodder). The assembled transcriptome was used to dissect transcriptional dynamics during dodder development and parasitism, and identified key gene categories involved in the process of plant parasitism. Host plant infection is accompanied with increased expression of parasite genes underlying transport and transporter categories, response to stress and stimuli, as well as genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall modifications. By contrast expression of photosynthetic genes is decreased in the dodder infective stages compared to normal stem. In addition, genes relating to biosynthesis, transport and response of phytohormones, such as auxin, gibberellins and strigolactone, were differentially expressed in the dodder infective stages compared to stem and seedlings. This analysis sheds light on the transcriptional changes that accompany plant parasitism and will aid in identifying potential gene targets for use in controlling infestation of crops by parasitic weeds.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.7fr20", "publicationDate": "2014-01-30", "dateAvailable": "2014-01-30", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7fr20", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Diverse molecular markers have been used to characterize populations of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), the main bacterial pathogen of cassava. Recently, diversity and population dynamics of Xam in the Colombian Caribbean coast were estimated using AFLPs, where populations were found to be dynamic, diverse and with haplotypes unstable across time. Aiming to examine the current state of pathogen populations located in the Colombian Eastern Plains, we also used AFLP markers and we evaluated the usefulness of Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) as  new molecular markers for the study of Xam populations. Results: The population analyses showed that AFLP and VNTR provide a detailed and congruent description of Xam populations from the Colombian Eastern Plains. These two typing \u2028strategies clearly separated strains from the Colombian Eastern Plains into distinct \u2028populations probably because of geographical distance. Although the majority of analyses were congruent between typing markers, fewer VNTRs were needed to detect a higher number of genetic populations of the pathogen as well as a higher genetic flow among sampled locations than those detected by AFLPs. Conclusions: This study shows the advantages of VNTRs over AFLPs in the surveillance of pathogen populations and suggests the implementation of VNTRs in studies that involve large numbers of Xam isolates in order to obtain a more detailed overview of the pathogen to improve the strategies for disease control.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.t173v", "publicationDate": "2014-06-24", "dateAvailable": "2014-06-24", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t173v", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In these simulations, the balance between reaction and molecular mixing plays a key role. To model molecular mixing, using a full multicomponent approach leads to high accuracy at the expense of a hefty computational cost. Thus, the use of a mixture-averaged model is usually preferred. Hence, this paper presents and tests a new OpenFOAM\u00ae-based code that incorporates a detailed, mixture-averaged approach for calculating transport properties in reacting flows, and provides a capability to solve either fully-compressible or low-Mach-number governing equations. The code is made readily available on GitHub and is written completely in OpenFOAM\u00ae\u2019s native code framework, making it highly portable and easy to maintain, enhance, and extend.

Here, we describe that dynamic acetylation of PCK1 interconverts the enzyme between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic activities. Under high glucose, p300-dependent hyperacetylation of PCK1 did not lead to protein degradation but instead increased the ability of PCK1 to perform the anaplerotic reaction, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. Lys91 acetylation destabilizes the active site of PCK1 and favors the reverse reaction. At low energy input, we demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates PCK1 and fully restores the gluconeogenic ability of PCK1. Additionally, we found that GSK3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation of PCK1 decreases acetylation and increases ubiquitination. Biochemical evidence suggests that serine phosphorylation adjacent to Lys91 stimulates SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of PCK1. This work reveals an unexpected capacity of hyperacetylated PCK1 to promote anaplerotic activity, and the intersection of post-translational control of PCK1 involving acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. \n\nRaw image data related to \"Dynamic acetylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase toggles enzyme activity between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions\".

To attain the desired physical architecture, the interactions of a cell with neighboring cells, the extracellular environment, and the soluble local and systemic cues held within that environment must be perfectly choreographed. The presented studies sought to explore these important biological features in the context of organogenesis. While this topic has been explored in other organ models, the feather bud offers a unique advantage in its complex architecture and representation of a multitude of cellular events embodied in a surgically and chemically manipulatable organ. Though research in the feather field has amassed a wealth of information pertaining to molecular signaling and stem cell biology, the dynamics of the ECM environment and the possible involvement of PCP signaling are not well-understood. \u2767 Examination of the Laminin matrix during feather organogenesis revealed a dynamic environment in which the matrix is organized and reorganized in response to the environmental needs of the developing feather organ. Identification of an important MMP14 activity in the degradation of the Laminin matrix at the site of feather bud formation revealed a previously unknown step in feather organogenesis. This opens an avenue for further experimentation to better understand how the microenvironment may be manipulated for the purposes of tissue engineering. The observed cellular dynamics identified a local region of directed cellular movement that may be an important part of feather bud development. In addition, the heterogeneous composition of the Laminin matrix suggests the localization of the various Laminin types in different regions of the feather bud basement membrane may correspond with differential cell-ECM interactions. Further studies to identify specific cell-surface receptors, their binding partners, and their differential localization will help to elucidate the particular interactions or signaling modules that facilitate the different cellular events involved in feather bud development. \u2767 The Collagen III matrix provides another example of an extremely dynamic environment. The dramatic changes observed during feather bud development and their coincidence with regional differences (e.g. bud vs. interbud and proximal vs. distal feather bud) and developmental stages (e.g. achieving competency in the feather field, progression from a symmetric to asymmetric organ, and development of secondary barb ridge structures) supports the importance of the ECM environment during organogenesis. The size of the developing feather bud makes it particularly valuable for visualizing the organization of the matrix in its entirety within one organ unit, a particularly difficult task in many organ models. Further studies to identify the MMP responsible for remodeling the Collagen III matrix will be invaluable to understanding the regulation of its dynamics. The identification of cell surface receptors and their regional localization will be important in understanding how cells in the feather bud are differentially interacting with the Collagen III environment and what role those interactions play in the branching morphogenesis. \u2767 Lastly, while PCP signaling has been found to be involved in chondrogenesis in the avian model, a role had not been previously established in feather bud development. The stringently aligned structure of the developing barb ridge and the loss of proper axial and marginal plate alignment following Stbm overexpression strongly suggests a possible role for Stbm in maintaining the cellular polarity. Further studies will be needed to determine whether Stbm and SHH have the same mutually-regulating relationship in branching morphogenesis as was found in neural tube development and address whether Stbm-SHH is responsible for modifying the architectural spacing of barb ridges. The perturbation of the overall embryonic feather follicle shape following overexpression of Fz-7, likewise, requires more examination to determine the mechanism by which it is exerting its effect on peridermal convergent extension. Furthermore, it will be important to identify the Fz-7-binding Wnt ligand to distinguish the molecular signaling pathway involved in regulating feather follicle curvature. \u2767 Exploration of biological architectural design and how that is manifested through biophysical and biochemical properties characteristic of various aspects of organogenesis is valuable for furthering the field of tissue engineering. The presented studies explore cellular dynamics, extracellular environment, and molecular signaling and demonstrate that the feather bud model can be a powerful tool that can lend itself to developing strategies for regenerative medicine.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-589786", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-589786", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Diverse molecular markers have been used to characterize populations of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), the main bacterial pathogen of cassava. Recently, diversity and population dynamics of Xam in the Colombian Caribbean coast were estimated using AFLPs, where populations were found to be dynamic, diverse and with haplotypes unstable across time. Aiming to examine the current state of pathogen populations located in the Colombian Eastern Plains, we also used AFLP markers and we evaluated the usefulness of Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) as  new molecular markers for the study of Xam populations. Results: The population analyses showed that AFLP and VNTR provide a detailed and congruent description of Xam populations from the Colombian Eastern Plains. These two typing \u2028strategies clearly separated strains from the Colombian Eastern Plains into distinct \u2028populations probably because of geographical distance. Although the majority of analyses were congruent between typing markers, fewer VNTRs were needed to detect a higher number of genetic populations of the pathogen as well as a higher genetic flow among sampled locations than those detected by AFLPs. Conclusions: This study shows the advantages of VNTRs over AFLPs in the surveillance of pathogen populations and suggests the implementation of VNTRs in studies that involve large numbers of Xam isolates in order to obtain a more detailed overview of the pathogen to improve the strategies for disease control.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.t173v", "publicationDate": "2014-06-24", "dateAvailable": "2014-06-24", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t173v", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Long-term stable polymorphism at the host and parasite coevolving loci is characteristic of trench warfare, and is expected to promote molecular signatures of balancing selection, while the recurrent allele fixation in arms races should generate selective sweeps. We compare these two scenarios using a finite size haploid gene-for-gene model that includes both mutation and genetic drift. We first show that trench warfare do not necessarily display larger numbers of coevolutionary cycles per unit of time than arms races. We subsequently perform coalescent simulations under these dynamics to generate sequences at both host and parasite loci. Genomic footprints of recurrent selective sweeps are often found, whereas trench warfare yield signatures of balancing selection only in parasite sequences, and only in a limited parameter space. Our results suggest that deterministic models of coevolution with infinite population sizes do not predict reliably the observed genomic signatures, and it may be best to study parasite rather than host populations to find genomic signatures of coevolution such as selective sweeps or balancing selection.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.bf6m4", "publicationDate": "2014-04-09", "dateAvailable": "2014-04-09", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bf6m4", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

This software is designed to emulate time-lapse microscopy experiments of colloidal fluids in quasi-2D situations, such as sedimented layers of particles, optical trap confinement, or fluid interfaces. Microrheology of bio-inspired fluids through optical-based techniques such as videomicroscopy is a classic tool for obtaining the mechanical properties and molecular behavior of these materials. The results obtained by microrheology notably depend of the time-lapse value of the videomicroscopy setup, therefore, a tool to test the influence of the lack of statistics by simulating Brownian objects in experimental-like situations is needed. We simulate a colloidal fluid by using Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations, where the particles are subjected to different external applied forces and inter-particle interactions. This software has been tested for the analysis of the microrheological consequences of attractive forces between particles [1], the influence of image analysis on experimental microrheological results [2], and to explore experimental diffusion with optical tweezers [3]. The output results of BDL are directly compatible with the format used by standard microrheological algorithms [4].

While biodiversity hotspots encompass a small fraction of Earth\u2019s land surface, more than half the world\u2019s plants and two-thirds of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these hotspots. Tropical Southeast Asia displays extraordinary species richness, encompassing four biodiversity hotspots, though disentangling multiple potential drivers of species richness is confounded by the region\u2019s dynamic geological and climatic history. Here, we use multi-locus molecular genetic data from dense multi-species sampling of freshwater fishes across three biodiversity hotspots, to test the effect of Quaternary climate change and resulting drainage rearrangements on aquatic faunal diversification.

The primers must be specific to the gene. Choosing the right primers are somewhat difficult and sometimes led to mismatching. Several primer design systems have been developed to overcome this problem. In this study, the Dynamic Pattern Matching technique has been developed and applied to find bacterial universal primers and specific primers for Glycoside Hydrolase Family 45 genes. Aligned sequences from test sets are entered into the system which consists of three steps: data reformation, primer design, and property filtering. First, degenerate and consensus sequences are calculated using statistical models. The results are combined with Gibbs Free Energy to design and select the most appropriate sequences as a series of primer sets. Moreover, users can also adjust their own criteria for each primer set. The results indicate that the degenerate primers designed by our proposed system are proved to be positive.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2011.77", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2011.77", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

Currently, little information is available on the genetic diversity of Echinococcus species among livestock in Sudan. In the present study, fifty (n\u2009=\u200950) hydatid cysts were collected from cattle carcasses (one cyst sample per animal) at Al-kadarou slaughterhouse, Khartoum North, Sudan. DNA was extracted from protoscolices and the germinal layer of each cyst and subsequently amplified by PCR targeting the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NADH-1) gene. The amplified PCR products were purified and subjected to direct sequencing for subsequent construction of phylogenetic tree and net work analysis.\n\nResults: The phylogenetic tree revealed the presence of Echinococcus canadenesis genotype 6 (G6) in 44 cysts (88.0%), Echinococcus ortleppi genotype 5 (G5) in 4 cysts (8.0%) and Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s) genotype 1 (G1) in 2 cysts (4.0%). The phylogenetic network analysis revealed genetic variation among the different haplotypes/genotypes. This report has provided, for the first time, an insight of the role of cattle in the transmission of the zoonotic G1 echinococosis.\n\nConclusions: The results of the study illustrate that Sudanese breeds of cattle may play an important role in the transmission dynamics and the epidemiology of cystic echinococcosis in Sudan.

We compiled a spatio-temporally comprehensive dataset of influenza B viruses, comprising over 2,500 genomes sampled worldwide between 1987 and 2015, including 382 newly-sequenced genomes that fill substantial gaps in previous molecular surveillance studies. Our contributed data increase the number of available influenza B virus genomes in Europe, Africa and Central Asia, improving the global context to study influenza B viruses. We reveal Yamagata-lineage diversity results from co-circulation of two antigenically-distinct groups that also segregate genetically across the entire genome, without evidence of intra-lineage reassortment. In contrast, Victoria-lineage diversity stems from geographic segregation of different genetic clades, with variability in the degree of geographic spread among clades. Differences between the lineages are reflected in their antigenic dynamics, as Yamagata-lineage viruses show alternating dominance between antigenic groups, while Victoria-lineage viruses show antigenic drift of a single lineage. Structural mapping of amino acid substitutions on trunk branches of influenza B gene phylogenies further supports these antigenic differences and highlights two potential mechanisms of adaptation for polymerase activity.

Quercus sect. Heterobalanus is now distributed across the Himalaya\u2013Hengduan Mountains (HHM) and warm lowland in East China, yet how the distribution patterns of this group changed in response to the HHM uplift remains largely unknown. This study examines the effect of tectonic events in the HHM region on the oaks, providing a biological perspective on the geological history of this region. Fifty-six populations of Quercus sect. Heterobalanus were genotyped using four chloroplast DNA regions and nine nuclear simple sequence repeat loci to assess population structure and diversity, supplemented by molecular dating and ancestral area reconstructions. The underlying demographic dynamics were compared using ecological niche models of the species distributions during the last glacial maximum and the present. These analyses illustrate that Quercus sect. Heterobalanus diversified as the HHM uplifted and climatic cooling during the mid-Miocene, colonizing the cold habitats from warm broadleaf mixed forests. Lineages in cold highlands and warm lowlands have diverged as a consequence of local adaptation to diverging climates since the late Miocene. Our results suggest that continuous uplift of the HHM in the late Miocene to early Pliocene accompanied by simultaneous cooling triggered the differentiation of oaks.

This adjustment often occurs through a Brownian diffusion process along the branches of the phylogeny that generates model residuals or the traits themselves. For high-dimensional traits, inferring all pair-wise correlations within the multivariate diffusion is limiting. To circumvent this problem, we propose phylogenetic factor analysis (PFA) that assumes a small unknown number of independent evolutionary factors arise along the phylogeny and these factors generate clusters of dependent traits. Set in a Bayesian framework, PFA provides measures of uncertainty on the factor number and groupings, combines both continuous and discrete traits, integrates over missing measurements and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty with the help of molecular sequences. We develop Gibbs samplers based on dynamic programming to estimate the PFA posterior distribution, over three-fold faster than for multivariate diffusion and a further order-of-magnitude more efficiently in the presence of latent traits. We further propose a novel marginal likelihood estimator for previously impractical models with discrete data and find that PFA also provides a better fit than multivariate diffusion in evolutionary questions in columbine flower development, placental reproduction transitions and triggerfish fin morphometry.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.6320t", "publicationDate": "2017-08-03", "dateAvailable": "2017-08-03", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6320t", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Here, we describe the synthesis of polycrystalline silver nanocrystals using Citrus sinensis acting as both reducing and capping agents. After exposing the silver ions to orange extract, rapid reduction of silver ions led to the formation of stable silver nanocrystals due to the reducing and stabilizing properties of orange fruit juice. The synthesized silver nanocrystals were characterized using various analytical techniques like UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The biochemical activity of the synthesized nanocrystals was studied in the light of affinity to bovine serum albumin using several biophysical methods like absorbance, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Cytotoxic activity of these nanocrystals was also studied against Hep-2 cell line using fluorescence microscopy.

South America was the cradle of their evolutionary history. During the Tertiary, xenarthrans experienced an extraordinary radiation, whereas South America remained isolated from other continents. The 13 living genera are relics of this earlier diversification and represent one of the four major clades of placental mammals. Sequences of the three independent protein-coding nuclear markers alpha2B adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B), breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA1), and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) were determined for 12 of the 13 living xenarthran genera. Comparative evolutionary dynamics of these nuclear exons using a likelihood framework revealed contrasting patterns of molecular evolution. All codon positions of BRCA1 were shown to evolve in a strikingly similar manner, and third codon positions appeared less saturated within placentals than those of ADRA2B and VWF. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of a 47 placental taxa data set rooted by three marsupial outgroups resolved the phylogeny of Xenarthra with some evidence for two radiation events in armadillos and provided a strongly supported picture of placental interordinal relationships. This topology was fully compatible with recent studies, dividing placentals into the Southern Hemisphere clades Afrotheria and Xenarthra and a monophyletic Northern Hemisphere clade (Boreoeutheria) composed of Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. Partitioned likelihood statistical tests of the position of the root, under different character partition schemes, identified three almost equally likely hypotheses for early placental divergences: a basal Afrotheria, an Afrotheria + Xenarthra clade, or a basal Xenarthra (Epitheria hypothesis). We took advantage of the extensive sampling realized within Xenarthra to assess its impact on the location of the root on the placental tree. By resampling taxa within Xenarthra, the conservative Shimodaira-Hasegawa likelihood-based test of alternative topologies was shown to be sensitive to both character and taxon sampling.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.1831", "publicationDate": "2010-08-10", "dateAvailable": "2010-08-10", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1831", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We address the history of trans-Arctic connections in a clade of amphi-boreal pelagic fishes using genealogical information from mitochondrial DNA sequence data. The Pacific and Atlantic herrings (Clupea pallasii and C. harengus) have basically vicarious distributions in the two oceans since pre-Pleistocene times. However, remote populations of C. pallasii are also present in the border waters of the North-East Atlantic in Europe. These populations show considerable regional and life history differentiation and have been recognized in subspecies classification. The chronology of the inter-oceanic invasions and genetic basis of the phenotypic structuring however remain unclear. Results: The Atlantic and Pacific herrings both feature high mtDNA diversities (large long-term population sizes) in their native basins, but an ocean-wide homogeneity of C. harengus is contrasted by deep east-west Pacific subdivision within Pacific C. pallasii. The outpost populations of C. pallasii in NE Europe are identified as members of the western Pacific C. pallasii clade, with some retained inter-oceanic haplotype sharing. They have lost diversity in colonization bottlenecks, but have also thereafter accumulated abundant new variation. The data delineate three phylogeographic groups within the European C. pallasii: herring from the inner White Sea; herring from the Mezen and Chesha Bays; and a strongly bottlenecked peripheral population in Balsfjord of the Norwegian Sea. Conclusions: The NE European outposts of C. pallasii are judged to be early post-glacial colonists from the NW Pacific. A strong regional substructure has evolved since that time, in contrast to the apparent broad-scale uniformity maintained by herrings in their native basins. The structure only partly matches the previous biological concepts based on seasonal breeding stocks or geographical subspecies designations. The trans-Arctic herring phylogeography is notably similar to those of the amphi-boreal mollusk taxa Macoma and Mytilus, suggesting similar histories of inter-oceanic connections. We also considered the time dependency of molecular rates, critical for interpreting timing of relatively recent biogeographical events, by comparing the estimates from coding and non-coding mitochondrial regions of presumably different mutation dynamics.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.q31f8", "publicationDate": "2013-05-22", "dateAvailable": "2013-05-22", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q31f8", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Regulators of FoxO3, including phosphorylation, energy stress, genotoxic stress, and cytokines, control its abundance, subcellular localization and DNA-binding capacity. In this paper we study how the identities and concentrations of growth factors are encoded in the dynamics of FoxO3 activation. Transcription factors like FoxO3 often switch between on and off states repeatedly over the course of a 12-24 hours period. Immunoblotting and similar methods can obscure this switching behavior due to asynchronicity between cells. In contrast, our use of time-lapse microscopy of fluorescent reporter proteins reveals that FoxO3 exhibits complex low wavelength and pulsatile translocation dynamics responsive to combinatorial control by ERK and Akt with the potential to encode the identities and concentrations of multiple extracellular growth factors.\n\nDataset Content:\n\nThis dataset includes raw datasets either in .MAT, or .CSV for regenerating all figures in the publication.

Two members of this family, designated as R5 and R5a, were attached to multiple sites of a dodecameric DNA duplex without severely perturbing the native B-form conformation. Measured X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, which report on nitroxide rotational motions, were found to vary depending on the location of the label and the identity of a phosphorothioate diastereomer (Rp or Sp).

Studies presented in this dissertation examine feasibility of probing local DNA structural and dynamic features using a class of nitroxides that are linked to chemically substituted phosphorothioate positions at the DNA backbone (R5-series). Two members of this family, designated as R5 and R5a, were attached to multiple sites of a dodecameric DNA duplex without severely perturbing the native B-form conformation. Measured X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, which report on nitroxide rotational motions, were found to vary depending on the location of the label and the identity of a phosphorothioate diastereomer (Rp or Sp). Spectral simulations and molecular modeling have been used to define basic principles for correlating observed variation in EPR spectra with site-specific structural and dynamic features in DNA. Overall, these studies advance our understanding of coupling between DNA and R5/R5a, which may ultimately enable the use of nucleotide-independent probes to obtain quantitative description of sequence-specific properties in large biologically relevant DNA molecules.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3729", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3729", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Although the relationships among the almost 200 living species are relatively well understood, we lack robust estimates of the timing of origin, ancestral morphology, and geographic range evolution of the clade. Here we integrate paleontological and molecular evidence to assess the evolutionary dynamics of extinct and extant platyrrhines. We develop novel analytical frameworks to infer the evolution of body mass, changes in latitudinal ranges through time, and species diversification rates using a phylogenetic tree of living and fossil taxa. Our results show that platyrrhines originated 5\u201310 million years earlier than previously assumed, dating back to the Middle Eocene. The estimated ancestral platyrrhine was small \u2013 weighing 0.4 kg \u2013 and matched the size of their presumed African ancestors. As the three platyrrhine families diverged, we recover a rapid change in body mass range. During the Miocene Climatic Optimum, fossil diversity peaked and platyrrhines reached their widest latitudinal range, expanding as far South as Patagonia, favored by warm and humid climate and the lower elevation of the Andes. Finally, global cooling and aridification after the middle Miocene triggered a geographic contraction of New World monkeys and increased their extinction rates. These results unveil the full evolutionary trajectory of an iconic and ecologically important radiation of monkeys and showcase the necessity of integrating fossil and molecular data for reliably estimating evolutionary rates and trends.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.sv43650", "publicationDate": "2018-06-18", "dateAvailable": "2018-06-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sv43650", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Results: We combined Illumina and PacBio technologies to complete the genome sequence of D. solani strain 3337 that was used as a reference to compare with 19 other genomes (including that of the type strain IPO2222 T ) which were generated by Illumina technology. This population genomic analysis highlighted an unexpected variability among D. solani isolates since it led to the characterization of two distinct sub-groups within the D. solani species. This approach also revealed different types of variations such as scattered SNP/InDel variations as well as replacing and additive horizontal gene transfers (HGT). Infra-species (between the two D. solani sub-groups) and inter-species (between D. solani and D. dianthicola) replacing HGTs were observed. Finally, this work pointed that genetic and functional variation in the motility trait could contribute to aggressiveness variability in D. solani. Conclusions: This work revealed that D. solani genomic variability may be caused by SNPs/InDels as well as replacing and additive HGT events, including plasmid acquisition; hence the D. solani genomes are more dynamic than that were previously proposed.

First this method of massively parallel and deep sequencing enables assessment of a comprehensive panel of genomic targets from a single sample, and second, it obviates the need for repeat invasive tissue biopsies. Digital SequencingTM is a novel method for high-quality sequencing of circulating tumor DNA simultaneously across a comprehensive panel of over 50 cancer-related genes with a simple blood test. Here we report the analytic and clinical validation of the gene panel. Analytic sensitivity down to 0.1% mutant allele fraction is demonstrated via serial dilution studies of known samples. Near-perfect analytic specificity (&gt; 99.9999%) enables complete coverage of many genes without the false positives typically seen with traditional sequencing assays at mutant allele frequencies or fractions below 5%. We compared digital sequencing of plasma-derived cell-free DNA to tissue-based sequencing on 165 consecutive matched samples from five outside centers in patients with stage III-IV solid tumor cancers. Clinical sensitivity of plasma-derived NGS was 85.0%, comparable to 80.7% sensitivity for tissue. The assay success rate on 1,000 consecutive samples in clinical practice was 99.8%. Digital sequencing of plasma-derived DNA is indicated in advanced cancer patients to prevent repeated invasive biopsies when the initial biopsy is inadequate, unobtainable for genomic testing, or uninformative, or when the patient\u2019s cancer has progressed despite treatment.

This thesis explores the possible application of doped polyaniline (PANI) fibers for recovering and producing water from atmospheric sources.; Chapter 2 details the measurements carried out for the sorption equilibrium and transport of water into commercially-produced PANI solid fibers from a 50% relative humidity air stream at ambient pressure of ~0.1 MPa and temperature 300 K. The data were collected using a single solid fiber morphology, PANION, but with different acid dopants used to change the PANI from its emeraldine base (EB; insulating), PANI-EB, to the emeraldine salt (ES; conducting) form, PANI-ES. The sorption process was well-described by the unsteady Fickian diffusion into an infinite cylinder. The rates and equilibrium capacities depended on the acid dopant utilized, but did not vary monotonically with the anion size or the acid strength. The measured adsorption/desorption water capacities varied between 20 and 75 mg H2O/g dry polymer, depending on the anion dopant. The BF4- and H2PO4- doped fibers had the highest capacities. When the mass loading was recalculated on a per H2O molecule/polymer repeat unit basis, most doped fibers had a capacity of ~0.5 H2O per PANI-ES repeat unit. The exceptions were the BF4- and H2PO4- doped fibers, for which the value was ~1. The apparent diffusion coefficients varied between 0.07-0.39 x 10-12 m2/s, and were larger during adsorption than desorption. The water capacity of the PANI solid fibers is at the upper-end of what is usually observed for glassy polymers, and provides the possibility for exploiting its electronic conductivity, good mechanical strength, and desiccant qualities for water recovery from atmospheric sources, as well as for advanced humidity control and sensing applications.; Chapter 3 presents the measurements performed for the sorption equilibrium and transport of water vapor into PANI asymmetric, microporous hollow fibers doped with phosphoric acid (H3PO4).  The data were obtained under exposure to air streams at an ambient pressure of ~0.1 MPa at various relative humidities and temperatures of 300 - 309 K. The sorption process was well-described by the unsteady Fickian diffusion into an infinite hollow cylinder. The asymmetric and porous nature of the hollow fiber's wall was represented by using an effective medium approach. The quantitative adsorption/desorption rates and equilibrium capacities depended on the experimental conditions, with the measured water capacities being between 33 and 75 mg H2O/g dry polymer under most conditions, though at the highest relative humidity(~80% at 300 K) the fiber adsorbed almost 250 mg H2O/g. For relative humidities \u226450%, when the mass loading was recalculated on a per H2O molecule/polymer repeat unit basis, the fiber had a capacity of ~0.5 to 1 H2O per PANI-ES repeat unit. In this same range of humidities, the apparent diffusion coefficients varied between 0.21-0.67 x 10-12 m2/s, except for the case of desorption at 80% RH wherein a value of 2.38 x 10-12 m2/s was obtained. In general, the apparent diffusion coefficients were always larger during desorption than adsorption. The water capacity of the PANI hollow fibers was found to be similar to that of the solid fiber (with the same dopant) under similar conditions.; Chapter 4 describes the atomistic simulation carried out for diffusion and sorption of water in polyaniline doped with HCl and HBr. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation techniques were used to develop atomistic models of HCl- and HBr- doped conducting PANI and to study diffusion and adsorption of water vapor in these polymers. Various morphological properties of the polymers were computed, including their pair correlation functions that were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data, and their accessible free volumes. The sorption isotherms and self-diffusivity of water vapor in the polymers were also computed at various temperatures. The computed sorption isotherms were in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data, while the diffusivities were within an order of magnitude of the data. The computed activation energy compared well with that published in the literature for water sorption in doped polyaniline.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m581", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m581", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

While many studies are increasingly producing results on the importance of selection, little is known about the interaction between drift and selection. Moreover there is still little knowledge on the spatial-temporal scales at which speciation occurs, i.e. arrangement of habitat patches, abruptness of habitat transitions, climate and habitat changes interacting with selective forces. To investigate these questions, we quantified variation on a fine geographical scale analysing morphological (shell) and genetic datasets coupled with environmental data in the land snail Murella muralis, endemic to the Mediterranean island of Sicily. Analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI) and eight nuclear microsatellite loci showed that genetic variation is highly structured at a very fine spatial scale by local palaeogeographical events and historical population dynamics. Molecular clock estimates, calibrated here specifically for Tyrrhenian land snails, provided a framework of palaeogeographical events responsible for the observed geographical variations and migration routes. Finally, we showed for the first time well documented lines of evidences of selection in the past, which explains divergence of land snail shell shapes. We suggest that time and palaeogeographical history acted as constraints in the progress along the ecological speciation continuum. Our study shows that testing for correlation among palaeogeography, morphology and genetic data on a fine geographical scale provides information fundamental for a detailed understanding of ecological speciation processes.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.v84jr", "publicationDate": "2012-10-10", "dateAvailable": "2012-10-10", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v84jr", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Fluorine, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms have practically insignificant contribution to the HOMO. Time dependent DFT calculations were used to study excitations, while natural transition orbitals were used to study the charge transfer in the strongest excitation. The experimentally observed FTIR modes are compared with calculated wavenumbers. Natural bond orbital analysis gives the idea about stability of molecules.

While many studies are increasingly producing results on the importance of selection, little is known about the interaction between drift and selection. Moreover there is still little knowledge on the spatial-temporal scales at which speciation occurs, i.e. arrangement of habitat patches, abruptness of habitat transitions, climate and habitat changes interacting with selective forces. To investigate these questions, we quantified variation on a fine geographical scale analysing morphological (shell) and genetic datasets coupled with environmental data in the land snail Murella muralis, endemic to the Mediterranean island of Sicily. Analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI) and eight nuclear microsatellite loci showed that genetic variation is highly structured at a very fine spatial scale by local palaeogeographical events and historical population dynamics. Molecular clock estimates, calibrated here specifically for Tyrrhenian land snails, provided a framework of palaeogeographical events responsible for the observed geographical variations and migration routes. Finally, we showed for the first time well documented lines of evidences of selection in the past, which explains divergence of land snail shell shapes. We suggest that time and palaeogeographical history acted as constraints in the progress along the ecological speciation continuum. Our study shows that testing for correlation among palaeogeography, morphology and genetic data on a fine geographical scale provides information fundamental for a detailed understanding of ecological speciation processes.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.v84jr", "publicationDate": "2012-10-10", "dateAvailable": "2012-10-10", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v84jr", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The Amazon basin is thought to hold 30% of all river fish species in the world. Information about the ecology, reproduction, and recruitment of most species is still lacking, thus hampering fisheries management and successful conservation strategies. One of the key understudied issues in the study of population dynamics is recruitment. Fish larval ecology in tropical biomes is still in its infancy owing to identification difficulties. Molecular techniques are very promising tools for the identification of larvae at the species level. However, one of their limits is obtaining individual sequences with large samples of larvae. To facilitate this task, we developed a new method based on the massive parallel sequencing capability of next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with hybridization capture. We focused on the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase I (COI). The results obtained using the new method were compared with individual larval sequencing. We validated the ability of the method to identify Amazonian catfish larvae at the species level and to estimate the relative abundance of species in batches of larvae. Finally, we applied the method and provided evidence for strong temporal variation in reproductive activity of catfish species in the Ucayal\u00ed River in the Peruvian Amazon. This new time and cost effective method enables the acquisition of large datasets, paving the way for a finer understanding of reproductive dynamics and recruitment patterns of tropical fish species, with major implications for fisheries management and conservation.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.117tn", "publicationDate": "2016-12-29", "dateAvailable": "2016-12-29", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.117tn", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Despite the assumption that \u2018if you\n  build it, [the function] will come\u2019, current understanding of the\n  effects of urban stream restoration on stream ecosystem functions are\n  based on short term studies which may not capture variation in\n  restoration effectiveness over time. We quantified the impact of\n  stream restoration on nutrient and energy dynamics of urban streams by\n  studying 10 urban stream reaches (five restored, five unrestored) in\n  the Baltimore, Maryland, USA, region over a two-year period. We\n  measured gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER)\n  at the whole-stream scale continuously throughout the study and\n  nitrate (NO3-N) spiraling rates seasonally (spring, summer, autumn)\n  across all reaches. There was no significant restoration effect on\n  NO3-N spiraling across reaches. However, there was a significant\n  canopy cover effect on NO3-N spiraling, and directly comparing paired\n  sets of unrestored-restored reaches showed that restoration does\n  affect NO3-N spiraling after accounting for other environmental\n  variation. Furthermore, there was a change in GPP:ER seasonality, with\n  restored and open-canopied reaches exhibiting higher GPP:ER during\n  summer. The restoration effect, though, appears contingent upon\n  altered canopy cover, which is likely to be a temporary effect of\n  restoration and is a driver of multiple ecosystem services, e.g.,\n  habitat, riparian nutrient processing. Our results suggest that\n  decision-making about stream restoration, including evaluations of\n  nutrient benefits, clearly needs to consider spatial and temporal\n  dynamics of canopy cover and tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem\n  services.\n\n      \n  Here we provide model estimates for GPP, ER, and net ecosystem\n  productivity (NEP) from from 10 sites throughout the greater Baltimore\n  area.

Its mutation is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. The molecular mechanisms of these mutations are poorly understood. It recognizes -GATA- sites on the DNA, using its two zinc fingers ZnFn1 and ZnFn2. Mutations in ZnFn2 have been studied in the past and well known but recently ZnFn1 mutations are also being reported very frequently in breast cancer patients and there is very less knowledge available regarding the binding modes and mechanism. Here, we have investigated the structural and functional impact of GATA3 mutation M294K on the DNA-binding property. The structure was obtained and mutation was induced before subjecting it to the molecular docking followed by MD simulation. Our findings indicate that the somatic mutation M294K, reported in the GATA3 gene destabilizes the unbound structure but, when it forms the DNA-complex, its overall structural stability is restored by the wrapping architecture of ZnFn2 around the DNA in the palindromic region, leading to the enhanced kinetic stability. The mutation not only affects the ZnFn1 region alone but also influences the whole complex by inducing the conformational changes in the linker region between the two zinc fingers, bringing the two zinc fingers to closer proximity representing the flexibility in binding sites. Our findings provide a better understanding of ZnFn1 mutations and the possibility of a different strategy to target these genes for their clinical relevance. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Beyond certain age milestones, these conditions are routinely screened for in order to be caught at earlier, more manageable stages. Their treatments are currently limited, as the understanding of mechanisms leading from biomolecule oxidation to cellular dysfunction and to manifestation of a disease is largely incomplete. While routine cell activities are usually convoluted with participation from many types of biomolecules, their failures can be unraveled by focusing on oxidative damage on lipid membranes that are the foundation of the cellular architecture. The bilayer membrane compartmentalizes the cell and its organelles and hosts a variety of membrane protein functions. Changes in its properties, such as lateral fluidity and continuity, can result in unsuccessful functional protein complex assembly and in leakage of vital nourishments. \u2767 The research work presented in the following chapters focus on oxidation of membrane phospholipids. After an introduction with more details on how damages at the molecular level lead to well-studied aging-associated conditions, the dynamics of light sensitization-induced oxidation on a bilayer membrane composed of unsaturated lipids is analyzed, where the progress of lipid oxidation is monitored solely based on the overall membrane area changes. Oxidation results in increased polarity of the formerly hydrophobic tails, which alters the geometry of the molecule. Recognizing that the molecular intrinsic curvature can thus be affected by oxidative damage, the structural changes of a species utilizing such property in supporting bilayer membrane bending is then explored. Finally, the last study aimed to quantify the holistic membrane bending rigidity changes that arise from previously discussed structural changes to individual lipid molecules.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-218428", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-218428", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

We quantified the impact of\n  stream restoration on nutrient and energy dynamics of urban streams by\n  studying 10 urban stream reaches (five restored, five unrestored) in\n  the Baltimore, Maryland, USA, region over a two-year period. We\n  measured gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER)\n  at the whole-stream scale continuously throughout the study and\n  nitrate (NO3-N) spiraling rates seasonally (spring, summer, autumn)\n  across all reaches.

In the present study, the photochemical properties of phenothiazine aggregates were used for oxidative catalysis and synthesis of gold nanoparticles with potential applications in Boolean logic operations. Phenothiazines have the peculiar photochemical property, which is the stabilization of the photochemically-generated radical cation in their supramolecular aggregates. The phenothiazine radical cations exhibit pink color related to a broad visible spectral band with a peak at 520 nm.  In the present study, the pair radical cation/reduced form of two phenothiazines, 10H-phenothiazine (PHT) and 3,7-bis (phenylamino) phenothiazine-5-iodide, named here phenoaniline (PHA) were photochemically generated characterized by absorbance with a peak at the range of 520-550 nm, direct and spin-trapping EPR measurements. The radical cation and separated from the reduced form using the resin styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer containing iminodiacetate ions (Chelex 100\uf0d2). The radical cation entrapped in the resin remained stable and could be used for catalytic oxidation processes. The reduced form remained in aqueous solution and had its reducing properties used to produce gold nanoparticles. Reduced PHT produced gold nanoparticles with dimensions around 7 nm that were arranged in monodispersed supramolecular aggregates of ~60 nm, stabilized by oligomerized phenothiazine, whereas PHA formed anisotropic gold nanoparticles. The supramolecular aggregates of AuNP PHT showed the potential to be applied in Boolean logic systems using CTAB dispersion and citrate reaggregation.", "doi": "10.17632/4k4sk9nwss.1", "publicationDate": "2020-03-07", "dateAvailable": "2020-03-07", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4k4sk9nwss", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Using an innovative phylodynamic approach combining host and pathogen molecular data with landscape characteristics and host traits, we untangle the complex factors that drive transmission networks of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) in bobcats (Lynx rufus). We found that the urban landscape played a significant role in shaping FIV transmission. Even though bobcats were often trapped within the urban matrix, FIV transmission events were more likely to occur in areas with more natural habitat elements. Urban fragmentation also resulted in lower rates of pathogen evolution, possibly owing to a narrower range of host genotypes in the fragmented area. Combined, our findings show that urban landscapes can have impacts on a pathogen and its evolution in a carnivore living in one of the most fragmented and urban systems in North America.

Whether the same process governs lineage accumulation and trait disparity during continental colonization events is less clear. Here, we test this prediction by investigating the rate dynamics and trait evolution of one of Africa's most widespread amphibian colonizers, the true toads (Bufonidae). By reconstructing the most complete molecular phylogeny of African Bufonidae to date, we find that the diversification of lineages in Africa best conforms to a constant rate model throughout time and across subclades, with little support for EO. Evolutionary rates of life-history traits have similarly been constant over time. However, an analysis of generalists and specialists showed a shift toward higher speciation rates associated with habitat specialization. The overall lack of EO signal can be interpreted in a number of ways and we propose several explanations. Firstly, methodological issues might preclude the detection of EO. Secondly, colonizers might not experience true EO conditions and due to the size, ecological heterogeneity and age of landmasses, the diversification processes might be more complex. Thirdly, lower speciation rates of habitat generalists may have affected overall proliferation of lineages.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.21m3t", "publicationDate": "2017-04-11", "dateAvailable": "2017-04-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.21m3t", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In the non-photosymbiotic group nutrition comes exclusively from heterotrophic feeding, whereas the photosymbiotic group achieves a good part of its nutrition from algae hosted in the coral\u2019s tissue. These ecologic differences arose early in the evolutionary history of corals but with repeated evolutionary losses and presumably also gains of symbiosis since then. We assessed the biodiversity dynamics and environmental occupancy of both ecologic groups to identify times when the evolutionary losses of symbiosis as inferred from molecular analyses might have occurred and if these can be linked to environmental change. Two episodes are likely: The first was in the mid-Cretaceous when non-symbiotic corals experienced an origination pulse and started to become more common in deeper, non-reef habitats and on siliciclastic substrates initiating a long-term offshore trend in occupancy. The second was around the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary with another origination pulse and increased occupancy of deep-water settings in the non-symbiotic group. Environmental factors such as rapid global warming associated with mid-Cretaceous anoxic events and increased nutrient concentrations in Late Cretaceous\u2013Cenozoic deeper waters are plausible mechanisms for the shift.

Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species interactions across trophic levels, e.g. pollination and biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multi-trophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulations in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. 2. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model\u2019s ability to replicate temporally non-aggregated abundance data from the field, and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. 3. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. 4. The model captured &gt;70% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body-size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community\u2019s abundance and trait composition. Analyzing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. 5. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.41b5b06", "publicationDate": "2018-08-08", "dateAvailable": "2018-08-08", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.41b5b06", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Here we use a well-documented molecular approach to examine the structure of the community of natural enemies preying upon the squash bug, Anasa tristis, a herbivorous cucurbit pest that severely hinders organic squash and pumpkin production in the United States. Primer pairs were designed to examine the effects of organic management practices on the strength of these trophic connections and link this metric to measures of the arthropod predator complex density and diversity within an experimental open-field context. Replicated plots of butternut squash were randomly assigned to three treatments and were sampled throughout a growing season. Row-covers treatments had significant negative effects on squash bug and predator communities. In total, 640 predators were tested for squash bug molecular gut-content, of which 11% were found to have preyed on squash bugs, but predation varied over the season between predator groups (coccinellids, geocorids, nabids, web-building spiders and hunting spiders). Through the linking of molecular gut-content analysis to changes in diversity and abundance, these data delineate the complexity of interaction pathways on a pest that limits the profitability of organic squash production.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8c1p8", "publicationDate": "2014-03-27", "dateAvailable": "2014-03-27", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8c1p8", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Linking organismal level processes to underlying suborganismal mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and organ level constitutes a major challenge for predictive ecological risk assessments. This challenge can be addressed with the simple bioenergetic models in the family of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB), which consist of a small number of state equations quantifying universal processes, such as feeding, maintenance, development, reproduction and growth. 2. Motivated by the need for process-based models to evaluate the impact of endocrine disruptors on ecologically relevant endpoints, this paper develops and evaluates two general modeling modules describing demand-driven feedback mechanisms within the DEB modeling framework exerted by gonads on the allocation of resources to production of reproductive matter. 3. These modules describe iteroparous, semelparous and batch-mode reproductive strategies. The modules have a generic form with both positive and negative feedback components; species and sex specific attributes of endocrine regulation can be added without changing the core of the modules. 4. We demonstrate that these modules successfully describe time-resolved measurements of wet weight of body, ovaries and liver, egg diameter and plasma content of vitellogenin and estradiol in rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss) by fitting these models to published and new data, which require the estimation of less than two parameters per data type. 5. We illustrate the general applicability of the concept of demand-driven allocation of resources to reproduction by evaluating one of the modules with data on growth and seed production of an annual plant, the common bean (Phaseolis vulgaris).", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.58j9r88", "publicationDate": "2019-02-02", "dateAvailable": "2019-02-02", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.58j9r88", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Experimental reports indicate that Fc\u025bRI forms relatively small and finite-sized clusters when stimulated by a multivalent ligand. By contrast, modelling studies have shown that receptor cross-linking by a trivalent ligand may lead to the formation of large receptor superaggregates that may potentially give rise to hyperactive cellular responses. In this work, we have developed a Brownian dynamics-based spatio-temporal model to analyse Fc\u025bRI aggregation by a trivalent antigen. Unlike the existing models, which implemented non-spatial simulation approaches, our model explicitly accounts for the coarse-grained site-specific features of the multivalent species (molecules and complexes). The model incorporates membrane diffusion, steric collisions and sub-nanometre-scale site-specific interaction of the time-evolving species of arbitrary structures. Using the model, we investigated temporal evolution of the species and their diffusivities. Consistent with a recent experimental report, our model predicted sharp decay in species mobility in the plasma membrane in response receptor cross-linking by a multivalent antigen. We show that, due to such decay in the species mobility, post-stimulation receptor aggregation may become self-limiting. Our analysis reveals a potential regulatory mechanism suppressing hyperactivation of immune cells in response to multivalent antigens.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.7110686.v1", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.7110686.v1", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

We know that many biological factors, including plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microbes, regulate plant survival and the carbon-balance of arctic tundra, but these interactions are poorly understood. Recently, new advances in technology have allowed us to study belowground communities with resolution not previously possible, leading to new findings about the links between below and above ground community dynamics. Our research uses cutting-edge technology such as stable isotope tracing and molecular methods to investigate the role of soil microbial communities in the response of an Arctic ecosystem to climate change. We found that 1) mycorrhizal fungal networks link plants in tundra and play a critical role in the expansion of shrubs in Arctic landscapes with climate change; 2) as climate warms, tundra shrubs increasingly partner with mycorrhizal fungi that are specialized in the breakdown of the organic carbon stored in tundra soils; and 3) climate warming will alter the diversity and composition of free-living soil microbial communities in Arctic tundra and these changes will also lead to increased losses of carbon from soils. Our data suggest that microbial community change in Arctic tundra will act as a positive feedback to climate change, speeding up the rate of change in Low-Arctic tundra ecosystems.,Purpose: Effects of anthropogenic climate change have now been reported in all of the earth's biomes (Rosenzwieg et al. 2008) but Arctic regions, which sustain the highest rates of warming (Trenberth et al. 2007), have been particularly perturbed (Post et al. 2009). The stability of terrestrial Arctic ecosystems is of immediate concern because tundra soils store a disproportionally large share of the earth's C, and increased microbial decomposition of this C will feedback to climate on decadal timescales (Schuur et al. 2009). Soil microbes are central to the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems because of their dual role as decomposers of soil organic matter and as determinants of plant community diversity (van der Heijden et al. 2008), which in turn controls the quality and quantity of C inputs to soils (De Deyn et al. 2008, Bardgett et al. 2008). Yet, despite the importance of Arctic soils in the global C cycle, we know very little of the impacts of climate change on Arctic soil microbial communities, and even less of how these changes will feedback to the stability of tundra plant communities. In \"Carbon-flux and Microbial Community Dynamics in Low-Arctic Tundra\" we address critical gaps in our understanding of the role of soil microbial communities in the response of an Arctic ecosystem to climate change. Objectives: 1) To assess the ecological role of mycorrhizal networks (MNs) in plant interactions in a Low-Arctic tundra ecosystem; 2) To determine the effects of warming and increased nutrient availability on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community of a tundra shrub that is responsive to these climate change factors; 3) To determine the effects of climate warming on Arctic soil fungi and bacteria over time; 4) To assess the role of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in determining C-allocation to tundra plant rhizosphere organisms.,Summary: Arctic ecosystems store large amounts of carbon in plants and soil and this carbon may be released and contribute to carbon dioxide production as the climate warms. In the Arctic tundra however, plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microbes that regulate carbon are poorly understood. Across growing seasons, this project is investigating links between below and above ground community processes regarding carbon balance and transfer. Using new advances in technology, this work is identifying key microbial groups in the soil that are involved in the cycling of carbon in Arctic tundra and determining how carbon cycling will respond to climate change.,", "doi": "10.5443/11463", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "Limited", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5443%2F11463", "method": null, "source": "cisti.ipy", "type_cont": null},

Leakiness is concerning as it increases vaccination coverage required to prevent disease spread, and can promote evolution of increased pathogen virulence. Despite leakiness, vaccination may reduce pathogen load, affecting disease transmission dynamics. However, the impacts on post-transmission disease development and infectiousness in contact individuals are unknown. Here, we use transmission experiments involving Marek\u2019s disease virus in chickens to show that vaccination with a leaky vaccine substantially reduces viral load in both vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated contact individuals they infect. Consequently, contact birds are less likely to develop disease symptoms or die, show less severe symptoms when these are present, and shed less infectious virus themselves, when infected by vaccinated birds. These results highlight that even partial vaccination with a leaky vaccine can have unforeseen positive consequences in controlling the spread and symptoms of disease.,Data descriptions are all in the file \"MD analysis data filtering details.R\".

Tests for adaptive radiation in extant taxa are traditionally estimated from calibrated molecular phylogenies with little input from extinct taxa. With 85 putative species in 33 genera and over 400 described extinct species, the carnivoran superfamily Musteloidea is a prime candidate to investigate patterns of adaptive radiation using both extant- and fossil-based macroevolutionary methods. The species diversity and equally impressive ecological and phenotypic diversity found across Musteloidea is often attributed to 2 adaptive radiations coinciding with 2 major climate events, the Eocene-Oligocene transition and the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition. Here, we compiled a novel time-scaled phylogeny for 88% of extant musteloids and used it as a framework for testing the predictions of adaptive radiation hypotheses with respect to rates of lineage diversification and phenotypic evolution. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence for rapid bursts of lineage diversification at the origin of Musteloidea, and further analyses of lineage diversification rates using molecular and fossil-based methods did not find associations between rates of lineage diversification and the Eocene-Oligocene transition or Mid-Miocene Climate Transition as previously hypothesized. Rather, we found support for decoupled diversification dynamics driven by increased clade carrying capacity in the branches leading to a subclade of elongate mustelids. Supporting decoupled diversification dynamics between the subclade of elongate mustelids and the ancestral musteloid regime is our finding of increased rates of body length evolution, but not body mass evolution, within the decoupled mustelid subclade. The lack of correspondence in rates of body mass and length evolution suggest that phenotypic evolutionary rates under a single morphological metric, even one as influential as mass, may not capture the evolution of diversity in clades that exhibit elongate body shapes. The discordance in evolutionary rates between body length and body mass along with evidence of decoupled diversification dynamics suggests that body elongation might be an innovation for the exploitation of novel Mid-Miocene resources, resulting in the radiation of some musteloids.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.nj1bp", "publicationDate": "2017-05-01", "dateAvailable": "2017-05-01", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nj1bp", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In this work the applicability of parameter sets for the molecular interactions of ZIF-8 including guest molecules was investigated by comparing results of MD simulations with experiments. Using suitable parameter sets, the diffusion and the effect of the diffusing molecules on the window size were investigated for ethane and nitrogen. For ethane, two interesting effects were found at higher ethane loadings: reduction of the window size and, forces that push a given molecule toward the window. These two effects balance each other leading to a self-diffusivity nearly independent upon the concentration of ethane. For nitrogen a gate-opening effect could be found. This result is in agreement with experiments. The size of the windows increases at high loadings while this does not speed-up the nitrogen self-diffusivity. The complex interactions of host-host and host-guest molecules cause mutual hindrance of the nitrogen molecules and balance the speed of the mobility due to the larger window size. Moreover, the energy barrier for rotation of imidazolate linkers was studied by quantum mechanics (QM).

A cohort of transcripts increased during torpor, paradoxical because transcription effectively ceases at these low temperatures. We show that this increase occurs not by elevated transcription but rather by enhanced stabilization associated with maintenance and/or extension of long poly(A) tails.

The code makes use of platform-independent tools and can be readily transferred to any computer platform which can run python. It is straightforward to incorporate the code into the LAMMPS software as well as into other molecular simulation programs. In the computational part of this work, we evaluate the intramolecular entropy of atactic polystyrene and polyethylene melts in an all atom as well as in a coarse grained (CG) resolution at five temperatures between 400 and 450 K. For both polymers, coarse graining with its reduced system degrees of freedom and its softened bonded radial potential, causes a strong reduction of the entropy. However, the averaged entropy per degree of freedom in the CG case exceeds the one under atomistic resolution. Also the temperature dependence of the intramolecular entropy becomes weaker in the transition from an atomistic to a coarse grained description. The larger entropy of polyethylene in comparison to polystyrene under both resolutions is a consequence of its longer chain length. To simplify a comparison of the two polymers in the two considered resolutions, we analyze the total intramolecular entropy as well as its temperature gradient via a scaling of both quantities by the number of degrees of freedom. In the two studied systems and for both levels of resolution, a linear dependence of the intramolecular entropy on the temperature is identified.", "doi": "10.17632/xn3ccj6kym.1", "publicationDate": "2018-08-22", "dateAvailable": "2018-08-22", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xn3ccj6kym", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

In this work the applicability of parameter sets for the molecular interactions of ZIF-8 including guest molecules was investigated by comparing results of MD simulations with experiments. Using suitable parameter sets, the diffusion and the effect of the diffusing molecules on the window size were investigated for ethane and nitrogen. For ethane, two interesting effects were found at higher ethane loadings: reduction of the window size and, forces that push a given molecule toward the window. These two effects balance each other leading to a self-diffusivity nearly independent upon the concentration of ethane. For nitrogen a gate-opening effect could be found. This result is in agreement with experiments. The size of the windows increases at high loadings while this does not speed-up the nitrogen self-diffusivity. The complex interactions of host-host and host-guest molecules cause mutual hindrance of the nitrogen molecules and balance the speed of the mobility due to the larger window size. Moreover, the energy barrier for rotation of imidazolate linkers was studied by quantum mechanics (QM). The results show a very large activation energy about 200 kcal/mol for gate-opening phenomena.", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2013.48", "publicationDate": "2013-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2013.48", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

In brief, the experimental design consisted of two different OMR intensities (low-intensity: bole-only harvest, BO; high intensity: whole-tree harvest + forest floor removal, WT+FF) and unharvested control forest plots, with three replicates per treatment. Treatments were harvested in 1996, and replanted with containerized P. taeda seedlings at 2.5 m x 2.5 m spacing. Soil was sampled seasonally for 1 year (June 2014, September 2014, December 2014, and March 2015). At each sample date, 4 cores were taken within each replicate plot to a depth of 1 m, and separated into depth increments (0-10, 10-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm). The four cores/plot were then pooled by depth increment and homogenized to create a single homogenous sample for each replicate plot, from which a representative subsample was removed and stored at -80 \u00b0C for molecular analyses.

Next to reliable parameter estimation of intrinsic physical quantities such as neutrino masses and mixing angles, these transition amplitudes are important in hypothesis testing of potential extensions of the standard model of elementary particle physics, such as additional neutrino flavors. Hence, fast yet precise implementations are of high importance to research.

Within the Afrotropics, the Congo Basin contains the highest diversity of riverine fishes, yet it is unclear how this fauna was assembled. To address this, and the diversification dynamics of a continental radiation, we focus on African Mastacembelus spiny eels.\nLocation: Afrotropical freshwaters.\nMethods: The most complete molecular phylogeny to date was reconstructed for African spiny eels. Divergence times were estimated applying a Bayesian relaxed clock comparing fossil and geological calibrations across nuclear and mitochondrial trees. Biogeographic reconstructions, applying a dispersal\u2013extinction\u2013cladogenesis model and lineage diversification dynamics were examined.\nResults: Spiny eels originated in Asia and colonized Africa c. 15.4 Ma (95% HPD: 23.9\u20138.8 Ma) from which their subsequent radiation across the Afrotropics was best fitted by a constant rate model. Ancestral state estimation identified multiple colonization events into the Congo Basin, whereas all other regions were likely to have been colonized once indicating considerable geographic constraints. Application of the fossil calibration gave similar age estimates across datasets, whereas a geological calibration estimated considerably older nuclear divergences.\nMain conclusions: Despite profound environmental events during the evolutionary history of the group, there is no evidence for rapid lineage diversification. This finding supports several recent studies on tropical continental radiations that contrast to the common pattern of density-dependent diversification. We further show that dispersal has occurred into, as well as out of the Congo Basin, indicating the importance of this region in the generation of biodiversity.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.1jq96", "publicationDate": "2017-06-12", "dateAvailable": "2017-06-12", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1jq96", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Excluding Ponto-Caspian species originating in brackish waters and freshwater subterranean taxa, there are 11 formally recognized epigean freshwater species recorded from this country. They belong to 3 genera, each representing a different family: Gammarus (Gammaridae, 8 species or species complexes), Niphargus (Niphargidae, 2 epigean species) and Synurella (Crangonyctidae, one species). Their large-scale distribution patterns nevertheless remain obscure due to insufficient data, consequently limiting biogeographical interpretations. We provide extensive new data with high resolution distribution maps, thus improving the knowledge of the ranges of these taxa. Gammarus species display substantial altitudinal variability and patchy, fragmented distribution patterns. They occur abundantly, particularly in springs and streams, from lowlands to sub-mountainous and mountainous regions. In the light of recent molecular research, we hypothesize that the complex geomorphological dynamics of the Carpathian region during the Late Tertiary probably contributed to their allopatric distribution pattern. Contrasting with Gammarus, the genera Niphargus and Synurella exhibit low altitudinal variability, broad ecological valences and overlapping distributions, being widespread throughout the lowlands. The current distribution of N. hrabei and N. valachicus seems to be linked to the extent of the Paratethys during the Early Pliocene or Pleistocene. We further discuss the taxonomic validity of two synonymized and one apparently undescribed taxon, and provide an updated pictorial identification key that includes all taxa and forms discussed in our study. The mosaic distribution of epigean freshwater amphipod species in Romania shows that this region is particularly suitable for phylo- and biogeographical analyses of this group.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.fd8m9", "publicationDate": "2015-03-17", "dateAvailable": "2015-03-17", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fd8m9", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

While prior computational models of\r\ncytoskeletal dynamics have lead to many conceptual insights, an important niche still\r\nneeds to be filled with a high-resolution structural modeling framework, which includes\r\na minimally-complete set of cytoskeletal chemistries, stochastically treats reaction and\r\ndiffusion processes in three spatial dimensions, accurately and efficiently describes mechanical\r\ndeformations of the filamentous network under stresses generated by molecular\r\nmotors, and deeply couples mechanics and chemistry at high spatial resolution. To\r\naddress this need, we propose a novel reactive coarse-grained force field, as well as a\r\npublicly available software package, named the Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active\r\nNetworks (MEDYAN) , for simulating active network evolution and dynamics (available at\r\nwww.medyan.org). This model can be used to study the non-linear, far from equilibrium\r\nprocesses in active matter systems, in particular, comprised of interacting semi-flexible\r\npolymers embedded in a solution with complex reaction-diffusion processes. In this work,\r\nwe applied MEDYAN to investigate a contractile actomyosin network consisting of actin\r\nfilaments, alpha-actinin cross-linking proteins, and non-muscle myosin IIA mini-filaments.\r\nWe found that these systems undergo a switch-like transition in simulations from a random\r\nnetwork to ordered, bundled structures when cross-linker concentration is increased\r\nabove a threshold value, inducing contraction driven by myosin II mini-filaments.

EMAP aimed to advance the science of ecological monitoring and ecological risk assessment, guide national monitoring with improved scientific understanding of ecosystem integrity and dynamics, and demonstrate multi-agency monitoring through large regional projects. EMAP developed indicators to monitor the condition of ecological resources. EMAP also investigated designs that addressed the acquisition, aggregation, and analysis of multiscale and multitier data.

However, reduced complexity of island communities can also present ecological opportunities.  For example, amphibian diversity on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is generally lower than in the Philippines, but this island supports a surprisingly diverse endemic assemblage of Sulawesi fanged frogs (genus Limnonectes).  To explore evolutionary dynamics of this system, we examined molecular, morphological, and geographical variation of fanged frogs from these two regions.  Using genealogical concordance \u2013 a conservative standard \u2013 we identified 12 species on Sulawesi, only four of which are described.   One more species can be distinguished with morphology, and a Bayesian approach to species delimitation suggests our total species estimate on Sulawesi (n = 13) is still an underestimate.   After accounting for evolutionary history, a model with multiple body size optima in sympatric Limnonectes species is significantly preferred over a \u201crandom walk\u201d model where body size evolves by Brownian motion.  Additionally, morphological variation is higher among sympatric than non-sympatric species on Sulawesi, but not in the Philippines.  Taken together, these findings suggest that adaptive radiation of fanged frogs on Sulawesi was driven by natural selection to infiltrate ecological niches occupied by other lineages in the Philippines.  Our study supports the concept of ecological opportunity in community assembly: diversification in mature communities, such as the Philippines, is limited by a dearth of unoccupied ecological niches.  On Sulawesi however, evolutionary novelties originated in a predictable and replicated fashion in response to opportunities presented by a depauperate ancestral community.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8913", "publicationDate": "2011-03-24", "dateAvailable": "2011-03-24", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8913", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, the factors influencing potato aphid dynamics and susceptibility to natural enemies are largely undescribed, particularly in relation to facultative endosymbiotic bacteria, which can provide protection against parasitism and disease in some aphid species. This study investigated whether potato aphid susceptibility to one of its principal natural enemies, the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), varied in relation to aphid genotype and/or endosymbiont presence. Parasitism and aphid fitness assays were conducted on clonal lineages of aphids, harbouring their natural endosymbiont infections, collected over 3 years from separate geographic locations. Parasitized aphids were dissected to quantify parasitoid oviposition, larval development, and mummification. Amongst the 19 clonal lines of M. euphorbiae tested, seven aphid genotypes were identified, and 11 lines harboured one or both of the facultative endosymbionts Hamiltonella defensa Moran et al. and Regiella insecticola Moran et al.; H. defensa infections were associated exclusively with two of the seven M. euphorbiae genotypes. Parasitism resistance was detected in clonal lines belonging to a single aphid genotype and resulted from failure of parasitoid eggs to develop into larvae rather than failure of the parasitoid to oviposit. Contrary with studies of several other aphid species, there was little evidence that H. defensa provided strong protection to M. euphorbiae from parasitism by A. ervi. Furthermore, there were no clear fitness costs to the aphid associated with parasitism resistance or with H. defensa infection. The two M. euphorbiae genotypes in which H. defensa occurred, which included the resistant genotype, exhibited faster development, higher survival, and greater fecundity than the other five aphid genotypes. These findings suggest that biological control of M. euphorbiae using A. ervi alone could exacerbate pest problems by selecting for the fittest parasitism-resistant genotypes.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.0t667", "publicationDate": "2016-12-27", "dateAvailable": "2016-12-27", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.0t667", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Diel trends among different protistan taxonomic groups reflected distinct nutritional capabilities and temporal niche partitioning. Changes in relative metabolic activities among phototrophs corresponded to the light cycle, generally peaking in mid- to late-afternoon. Metabolic activities of protistan taxa with phagotrophic ability were higher at night, relative to daytime, potentially in response to increased availability of picocyanobacterial prey. Tightly correlated Operational Taxonomic Units throughout the diel cycle implicated the existence of parasitic and mutualistic relationships within the microbial eukaryotic community, underscoring the need to define and include these symbiotic interactions in marine food web descriptions. This study provided a new high-resolution view into the ecologically important interactions among primary producers and consumers that mediate the transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels. Characterizations of the temporal dynamics of protistan activities contribute knowledge for predicting how these microorganisms respond to environmental forcing factors.\n\n \n\nSee github for additional information on data analysis.", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.1243295", "publicationDate": "2018-05-08", "dateAvailable": "2018-12-20", "version": null, "accessRights": "info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess", "containerURI": "https://zenodo.org/record/1243295", "method": null, "source": "ZENODO", "type_cont": "article"},

Because the insertion of TEs in new genomic positions is largely deleterious, the molecular mechanisms for transcriptional suppression have been extensively studied. In contrast, very little is known about their primary transcriptional regulation. Here, we characterize the expression dynamics of TE families in Drosophila melanogaster across a broad temperature range (13\u201329\u00b0C). In 71% of the expressed TE families, the expression is modulated by temperature. We show that this temperature-dependent regulation is specific for TE families and strongly affected by the genetic background. We deduce that TEs carry family-specific regulatory sequences, which are targeted by host-specific trans-acting factors, such as transcription factors. Consistent with the widespread dominant inheritance of gene expression, we also find the prevailing dominance of TE family expression. We conclude that TE family expression across a range of temperatures is regulated by an interaction between TE family-specific regulatory elements and trans-acting factors of the host.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.vg4d4", "publicationDate": "2017-07-19", "dateAvailable": "2017-07-19", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vg4d4", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Therefore, values in the range  with steps equal to 0.25 may be accounted for. The atoms labelled R or S can have negative and positive values assigned (e.g. \u22123 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom, or vice versa), opposed values (e.g. \u22123 for an R atom and 3 for an S atom, or vice versa), positive values (e.g. 3 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom) or negative values (e.g. \u22123 for an R atom and \u22121 for an S atom).

From QSAR modelling carried out on four chemical datasets (Cramer\u2019s steroids, fenoterol stereoisomer derivatives, N-alkylated 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-piperidines, and perindoprilat stereoisomers), it was demonstrated that the use of several correction factors contributes to the building of models with greater robustness and predictive ability than those reported in the literature, as well as with respect to the models exclusively developed with QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs based on the factor 1\u2009|\u2009\u22121.

The UM is a general circulation model (GCM) that solves the deep, nonhydrostatic equations of motion and uses a flexible and accurate radiative transfer scheme, based on the two-stream and correlated-k approximations, to calculate the heating rates. In this work we consistently couple a well-tested Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to solve for the chemical equilibrium abundances locally in each grid cell for a general set of elemental abundances, further improving the flexibility and accuracy of the model. As the metallicity of the atmosphere is increased we find significant changes in the dynamical and thermal structure, with subsequent implications for the simulated phase curve. The trends that we find are qualitatively consistent with previous works, though with quantitative differences. We investigate in detail the effect of increasing the metallicity by splitting the mechanism into constituents, involving the mean molecular weight, the heat capacity and the opacities. We find the opacity effect to be the dominant mechanism in altering the circulation and thermal structure.

The theoretical dependence of the shape of optical bands for the dye monomers in the vinylogous series in line with a change in the solvent polarity is considered. A simple physical (analytical) model of the shape of optical absorption bands in H-aggregates of polymethine dyes is developed based on taking the dozy-chaos dynamics of the transient state and the Frenkel exciton effect in the theory of molecular quantum transitions into account. As an example, the details of the experimental shape of one of the known H-bands are well reproduced by this analytical model under the assumption that the main optical chromophore of H-aggregates is a tetramer resulting from the two most probable processes of inelastic binary collisions in sequence: first, monomers between themselves, and then, between the resulting dimers. The obtained results indicate that in contrast with the compact structure of J-aggregates (brickwork structure), the structure of H-aggregates is not the compact pack-of-cards structure, as stated in the literature, but a loose alternate structure. Based on this theoretical model, a simple general (analytical) method for treating the more complex shapes of optical bands in polymethine dyes in comparison with the H-band under consideration is proposed. This method mirrors the physical process of molecular aggregates forming in liquid solutions: aggregates are generated in the most probable processes of inelastic multiple binary collisions between polymethine species generally differing in complexity.

However, in many species, experimental control over important factors that regulate division of labor, such as genotype and age, is limited. Furthermore, most species have fixed queen and worker castes, making it difficult to establish causality between the molecular mechanisms that underlie reproductive division of labor, the hallmark of insect societies. Here we present the genome of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, a powerful new study system that does not suffer from these constraints. Using cytology and RAD-seq, we show that C. biroi reproduces via automixis with central fusion and that heterozygosity is lost extremely slowly. As a consequence, nestmates are almost clonally related (r = 0.996). Workers in C. biroi colonies synchronously alternate between reproduction and brood care, and young workers eclose in synchronized cohorts. We show that genes associated with division of labor in other social insects are conserved in C. biroi and dynamically regulated during the colony cycle.

The study of developmental variation has been hampered by the lack of quantitative methods for the joint analysis of embryo shape and the spatial distribution of cellular activity within the developing embryo geometry. By drawing from the strength of geometric morphometrics and pixel/voxel-based image analysis, we present a new approach for the biometric analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional embryonic images. Well-differentiated structures are described in terms of their shape, whereas structures with diffuse boundaries, such as emerging cell condensations or molecular gradients, are described as spatial patterns of intensities. We applied this approach to microscopic images of the tail fins of larval and juvenile rainbow trout. Inter-individual variation of shape and cell density was found highly spatially structured across the tail fin and temporally dynamic throughout the investigated period.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.1fq87", "publicationDate": "2014-12-16", "dateAvailable": "2014-12-16", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1fq87", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The Drosophila Y chromosome has been gradually acquiring genes from the rest of the genome, with only seven Y-linked genes being gained over the past 63 million years (0.12 gene gains per million years). Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-powered genomic scan, we show that gene transfers to the Y chromosome are much more common than previously suspected: at least 25 have arisen across three Drosophila species over the past 5.4 million years (1.67 per million years for each lineage). The gene transfer rate is significantly lower in Drosophila melanogaster than in the Drosophila simulans clade, primarily due to Y-linked retrotranspositions being significantly more common in the latter. Despite all Y-linked gene transfers being evolutionarily recent (&lt;1 million years old), only three showed evidence for purifying selection (\u03c9 \u2264 0.14). Thus, although the resulting Y-linked functional gene acquisition rate (0.25 new genes per million years) is double the longer-term estimate, the fate of most new Y-linked genes is defined by rapid degeneration and pseudogenization. Our results show that Y-linked gene traffic, and the molecular mechanisms governing these transfers, can diverge rapidly between species, revealing the Drosophila Y chromosome to be more dynamic than previously appreciated. Our analytical method provides a powerful means to identify Y-linked gene transfers and will help illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of the Y chromosome in Drosophila and other species.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8ph59", "publicationDate": "2017-11-02", "dateAvailable": "2017-11-02", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8ph59", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We registered the specific location of the studies, calculated the number of studies by administrative region, mapped the study sites and identified the type of ecosystem services addressed. \n\nFor the identification of marine ecosystem services we defined ecosystem services as the benefits people obtain from coastal social-ecological systems (MA 2005) and identified the category of the ecosystem services addressed in the papers. The four ecosystem services categories that we distinguished are: supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural services (MA 2005; Sukhdev 2010; Wallace 2007). The first category was defined as the supporting services which refers to the conditions, structure and functioning of coastal social-ecological systems which are required for the provision of ecosystem services. In the supporting category we identified studies dealing with the biodiversity component using species richness and habitat conditions as proxies. Provisioning services are the goods that can be extracted and consumed from marine ecosystems which are often already valued in markets, like food provision, biotic materials, biofuels and water provision (Liquete et al. 2013). Regulating services are the benefits derived from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as the water purification, coastal protection, weather regulation, biological regulation among others (Liquete et al. 2013). Cultural services are the intangible benefits that emerge from interactions between humans and nature  (Chan et al. 2012a) for instance sense of identity, spiritual value, aesthetic value and cognitive development (Liquete et al. 2013).A further description of the categories can be found elsewhere (De Groot et al. 2010; Sukhdev 2010; Wallace 2007).

This procedure constitutes a generalization to that commonly used to date, where the values 1 and \u22121 (correction factor) are employed to weight the molecular vectors when each atom is labelled as R (rectus) or S (sinister) according to the Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog rules. Therefore, values in the range  with steps equal to 0.25 may be accounted for. The atoms labelled R or S can have negative and positive values assigned (e.g. \u22123 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom, or vice versa), opposed values (e.g. \u22123 for an R atom and 3 for an S atom, or vice versa), positive values (e.g. 3 for an R atom and 1 for an S atom) or negative values (e.g. \u22123 for an R atom and \u22121 for an S atom). These proposed Chiral QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs are real numbers, non-symmetric and reduced to \u2018classical\u2019 (non-chiral) QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs when symmetry is not codified (correction factor equal to zero). In this report, only the factors with opposed values were considered with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of this proposal. From QSAR modelling carried out on four chemical datasets (Cramer\u2019s steroids, fenoterol stereoisomer derivatives, N-alkylated 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-piperidines, and perindoprilat stereoisomers), it was demonstrated that the use of several correction factors contributes to the building of models with greater robustness and predictive ability than those reported in the literature, as well as with respect to the models exclusively developed with QuBiLS-MIDAS 3D-MDs based on the factor 1\u2009|\u2009\u22121.

TH induced a strong accumulation of LNCaP cells in mitosis, severe mitotic spindle defects, and asymmetric cell divisions, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe accompanied by cell death through apoptosis. However, unlike microtubule-binding drugs (vinblastine and paclitaxel), TH did not directly inhibit tubulin polymerization when tested in a cell-free system, whereas it reduced cellular microtubule polymer mass in LNCaP cells. This suggests that TH indirectly targets microtubule dynamics through inhibition of a critical regulator or tubulin-associated protein. Furthermore, TH is not a major substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is responsible for multidrug resistance in numerous cancers, providing a rationale to further study TH in cancers with Pgp-mediated treatment resistance. The identification of TH's molecular target in future studies will be of great value to the development of TH as potential treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.5249380", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.5249380", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

To aid conservation of those species, knowledge on the variability of mortality rates is essential. Unfortunately, however, individual-based multi-year data sets that are required for that have only rarely been collected for free-ranging long-lived mammals. Here, we used a five-year data set comprising activity data of 1445 RFID-tagged individuals of two long-lived temperate zone bat species, Natterer\u2019s bats (Myotis nattereri) and Daubenton\u2019s bats (Myotis daubentonii), at their joint hibernaculum. Both species are listed as being of high conservation interest by the European Habitats Directive. Applying mixed-effects logistic regression, we explored seasonal survival differences in these two species which differ in foraging strategy and phenology. In both species, survival over the first-winter of an individual\u2019s life was much lower than survival over subsequent winters. Focussing on adults only, seasonal survival patterns were largely consistent with higher winter and lower summer survival but varied in its level across years in both species. Our analyses, furthermore, highlight the importance of species-specific time periods for survival. Daubenton\u2019s bats showed a much stronger difference in survival between the two seasons than Natterer\u2019s bats. In one exceptional winter, the population of Natterer\u2019s bats crashed, while the survival of Daubenton\u2019s bats declined only moderately. While, our results confirm the general seasonal survival pattern typical for hibernating mammals with higher winter than summer survival, they also show that this pattern can be reversed under particular conditions.

It plays a vital role in many important processes inside our cells such as cell division, membrane healing, budding of certain viruses (such as HIV and Ebola), formation of multi vesicular bodies and many more. The mechanism by which ESCRT-III deforms membranes is unknown.\nMethod:\nWe developed a coarse-grained biophysical model of the complex and studied its membrane deforming abilities in molecular dynamics simulations using lammps (https://lammps.sandia.gov). The aim was to identify the physical skeleton of this bio machine - the core elements that drive membrane deformation. We therefore built a pre-assembled spiral filament resembling ESCRT-III once it polymerised and had it interact with a simulated membrane.\nResults:The filament consists of identical subunits that are interconnected via very strong bonds and each experience the same target curvature. The resulting target geometry of the filament would hence be a ring - however, the filament is longer and it instead grows into a spiral, which has internal tension since not all subunits can be at their desired curvature. We found that a 3 bead subunit that is interconnected to the next subunit via 9 specific bonds is required to give the filament this chiral curvature (unique direction of curvature in 3D). \n1. It was previously assumed that the inner tension due to its spiral shape (unsatisfied curvature) is what drives the filament to deform membranes. However, this would not explain why the deformations only occur away from the cytoplasm. We tested this hypothesis by placing our ESCRT-III spiral on a membrane and giving all subunits the same intrinsic curvature so that they would want to form a ring on the flat surface rather than a spiral. The result can be seen in 'Buckledepth_evolution.txt' (or Fig1 in the paper), which contains the time steps of our simulation and the corresponding buckle depth (measured by the smallest z-value of the filament at that time step). We can see that no buckle is forming despite the intrinsic tension of the spiral. So this tension can't be the driving force of the deformation.\n2. &amp; 3. Instead we found that there is one essential parameter that we call the tilt angle which decides whether the spiral stays flat on the membrane or forms a helix. This angle tilts the membrane attracted surface of the spiral out of its 2D plane into a 3D cone surface. Experimental evidence suggests that different ESCRT-III protein combinations can lead to very different deformations and that the transition from a flat spiral to a helix occurs because of such structural changes within the filament (e.g. depolymerisation or co-polymerisation).We tested this by introducing a tilt angle change from 0 degrees (flat) to 60 degrees making the target geometry of our filament a tilted ring. 'Buckledepth_evolution_down.txt ' contains the time steps with corresponding buckle depth for this simulation (see Fig 2 in the paper). Now we can indeed observe a downward buckle forming. Similarly if we tilt the filament in the opposite direction (target geometry change from 0 degrees to -40 degrees) we observe a buckle forming in the opposite direction as can be seen in 'Buckleheight_evolution.txt' (see Fig. 2 in the paper).\n4.We then studied the influence of the persistence length of the filament and the radius of the target geometry on the resulting buckle and found that a larger persistence length (stronger bonds between subunits) leads to more tubular (and hence deeper) deformations and a smaller radius results in narrower buckles (hence also deeper given we use the same filament length and it can form more loops in the helix). The data for this heat map is stored in Radius_persistencelength_depth.txt, which contains the target ring radius with matching persistence length and resulting buckle depth (compare to Fig.3 in the paper).\n5.We also studied how the radius and tilt angle affect the forming buckle and stored this data in 'Radius_tilt_z.txt', which contains the target state radius with matching tilt angle tau and the resulting buckle depth or height. At tilt 0 we get no deformations, for positive tilt angles we get downward buckles that become more tubular with increasing angle and for negative tilt angles we get upward buckles that also become more tubular as the modulus of the angle increases.These dataset are used to generate the heatmaps in Fig 3.\n6.Finally we found that a series of target geometry changes from spiral (tilt 0 degrees) to helix (tilt 60 degrees) and back to flat spiral (tilt 0 degrees) around a large cargo particle that is attracted to receptors within the membrane can lead to scission of this cargo particle. The vesicle buds off enclosed by a piece of the original membrane. 'smallcargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'smallcargo.xyz' (Fig 4.a) and 'largecargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'largecargo.xyz' (Fig 4.b). The difference is the size of the cargo particle and the percentage of receptor beads used. Both result in vesicle formation but in case b (large cargo) the filament enters an already existing membrane neck, whereas in case a (small cargo) it forms the neck itself. The simulation output files contain the x y and z coordinates of all particles within the simulation at any time step as well as the atom number, molecule id and particle type (1 membrane, 2 and 3 membrane attracted filament beads, 4 non attracted filament bead, 5 membrane receptor, 6 cargo particle).\n", "doi": "10.5522/04/9804494.v1", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC0", "containerURI": "https://rdr.ucl.ac.uk/articles/Changes_in_ESCRT-III_filament_geometry_drive_membrane_remodelling_and_fission_in_silico/9804494/1", "method": null, "source": "bl.ucld", "type_cont": null},

Balancing selection hypotheses imply that intermediate-frequency alleles disproportionately contribute to genetic variance of life-history traits and fitness. Such alleles may also associate with population genetic footprints of recent selection, including reduced genetic diversity and inflated linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. Here, we compare the evolutionary dynamics of different balancing selection models, and characterize the evolutionary timescale and hitchhiking effects of partial selective sweeps generated under antagonistic versus nonantagonistic (e.g., overdominant and frequency-dependent selection) processes. We show that the evolutionary timescales of partial sweeps tend to be much longer, and hitchhiking effects are drastically weaker, under scenarios of antagonistic selection. These results predict an interesting mismatch between molecular population genetic and quantitative genetic patterns of variation. Balanced, antagonistically selected alleles are expected to contribute more to additive genetic variance for fitness than alleles maintained by classic, nonantagonistic mechanisms.

We analyze the dynamics and effectiveness of #PorteOuverte by comparing its proportion of relevant logistical messages -- individuals requesting or offering shelter -- to other messages such as those offering emotional consolation or commenting on the hashtag itself.\u00a0 Our results reveal that the vast majority of messages are not relevant, however the crowd senses and spreads relevant messages more than others.\u00a0 We further demonstrate that relevant messages can be automatically detected and thus algorithmic promotion may be possible.\n\n\nData\n\n\nThe #PorteOuverte hashtag (\"opendoor\" in English), created right after the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, was used by individuals to offer shelter to strangers stranded by the attacks and by individuals in need of shelter to request help and post their whereabouts. The file #PorteOuverte _tweet_ids.txt contains all the original tweet ids that used this hashtag.\n\n\nThe first tweet was posted on Friday, 13 Nov 2015 21:34:06 GMT.\n\n\nDuration: 2015-11-13 to 2015-11-16 (retweets not included).\n\n\nTotal number of tweets: 75547\n\n\nPublication\n\n\nThis data set was created for our study.

The source code is in R and the data files are simple text files.\nAbstract of the associated paper:\nWe propose a forecasting approach for solar flares based on data from Solar Cycle 24, taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. In particular, we use the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) product that facilitates cut-out magnetograms of solar active regions (AR) in the Sun in near-realtime (NRT), taken over a five-year interval (2012 - 2016). Our approach utilizes a set of thirteen predictors, which are not included in the SHARP data, extracted from line-of-sight and vector photospheric magnetograms. We exploit several Machine Learning (ML) and Conventional Statistics techniques to predict flares of class &gt;M1 and &gt;C1, with a 24h forecast window. The ML methods used are Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). We conclude that Random Forests could be the prediction technique of choice for our sample, with the second best method being Multi-Layer Perceptrons, subject to an entropy objective function. A Monte Carlo simulation showed that the best performing method gives accuracy ACC=0.93(0.00), true skill statistic TSS=0.74(0.02) and Heidke skill score HSS=0.49(0.01) for a &gt;M1 class flares prediction with probability threshold 15% and ACC=0.84(0.00), TSS=0.60(0.01) and HSS=0.59(0.01) for a &gt;C1 class flares prediction with probability threshold 35%.

It plays a vital role in many important processes inside our cells such as cell division, membrane healing, budding of certain viruses (such as HIV and Ebola), formation of multi vesicular bodies and many more. The mechanism by which ESCRT-III deforms membranes is unknown.\nMethod:\nWe developed a coarse-grained biophysical model of the complex and studied its membrane deforming abilities in molecular dynamics simulations using lammps (https://lammps.sandia.gov). The aim was to identify the physical skeleton of this bio machine - the core elements that drive membrane deformation. We therefore built a pre-assembled spiral filament resembling ESCRT-III once it polymerised and had it interact with a simulated membrane.\nResults:The filament consists of identical subunits that are interconnected via very strong bonds and each experience the same target curvature. The resulting target geometry of the filament would hence be a ring - however, the filament is longer and it instead grows into a spiral, which has internal tension since not all subunits can be at their desired curvature. We found that a 3 bead subunit that is interconnected to the next subunit via 9 specific bonds is required to give the filament this chiral curvature (unique direction of curvature in 3D). \n1. It was previously assumed that the inner tension due to its spiral shape (unsatisfied curvature) is what drives the filament to deform membranes. However, this would not explain why the deformations only occur away from the cytoplasm. We tested this hypothesis by placing our ESCRT-III spiral on a membrane and giving all subunits the same intrinsic curvature so that they would want to form a ring on the flat surface rather than a spiral. The result can be seen in 'Buckledepth_evolution.txt' (or Fig1 in the paper), which contains the time steps of our simulation and the corresponding buckle depth (measured by the smallest z-value of the filament at that time step). We can see that no buckle is forming despite the intrinsic tension of the spiral. So this tension can't be the driving force of the deformation.\n2. &amp; 3. Instead we found that there is one essential parameter that we call the tilt angle which decides whether the spiral stays flat on the membrane or forms a helix. This angle tilts the membrane attracted surface of the spiral out of its 2D plane into a 3D cone surface. Experimental evidence suggests that different ESCRT-III protein combinations can lead to very different deformations and that the transition from a flat spiral to a helix occurs because of such structural changes within the filament (e.g. depolymerisation or co-polymerisation).We tested this by introducing a tilt angle change from 0 degrees (flat) to 60 degrees making the target geometry of our filament a tilted ring. 'Buckledepth_evolution_down.txt ' contains the time steps with corresponding buckle depth for this simulation (see Fig 2 in the paper). Now we can indeed observe a downward buckle forming. Similarly if we tilt the filament in the opposite direction (target geometry change from 0 degrees to -40 degrees) we observe a buckle forming in the opposite direction as can be seen in 'Buckleheight_evolution.txt' (see Fig. 2 in the paper).\n4.We then studied the influence of the persistence length of the filament and the radius of the target geometry on the resulting buckle and found that a larger persistence length (stronger bonds between subunits) leads to more tubular (and hence deeper) deformations and a smaller radius results in narrower buckles (hence also deeper given we use the same filament length and it can form more loops in the helix). The data for this heat map is stored in Radius_persistencelength_depth.txt, which contains the target ring radius with matching persistence length and resulting buckle depth (compare to Fig.3 in the paper).\n5.We also studied how the radius and tilt angle affect the forming buckle and stored this data in 'Radius_tilt_z.txt', which contains the target state radius with matching tilt angle tau and the resulting buckle depth or height. At tilt 0 we get no deformations, for positive tilt angles we get downward buckles that become more tubular with increasing angle and for negative tilt angles we get upward buckles that also become more tubular as the modulus of the angle increases.These dataset are used to generate the heatmaps in Fig 3.\n6.Finally we found that a series of target geometry changes from spiral (tilt 0 degrees) to helix (tilt 60 degrees) and back to flat spiral (tilt 0 degrees) around a large cargo particle that is attracted to receptors within the membrane can lead to scission of this cargo particle. The vesicle buds off enclosed by a piece of the original membrane. 'smallcargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'smallcargo.xyz' (Fig 4.a) and 'largecargo.in' is the read-in file for lammps used to generate the simulation output 'largecargo.xyz' (Fig 4.b). The difference is the size of the cargo particle and the percentage of receptor beads used. Both result in vesicle formation but in case b (large cargo) the filament enters an already existing membrane neck, whereas in case a (small cargo) it forms the neck itself. The simulation output files contain the x y and z coordinates of all particles within the simulation at any time step as well as the atom number, molecule id and particle type (1 membrane, 2 and 3 membrane attracted filament beads, 4 non attracted filament bead, 5 membrane receptor, 6 cargo particle).\n", "doi": "10.5522/04/9804494", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5522%2F04%2F9804494", "method": null, "source": "bl.ucld", "type_cont": null},

Among all the applications, energy storage devices and electronic/optoelectronic devices are two of the most appealing topics. During my Ph.D. study, I conduct research on the two major topics: 1. Study of novel silicon (Si) nanostructures and their application as lithium-ion battery anode materials; 2. Electronic and optoelectronic device study of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials. \u2767 This dissertation starts from a brief introduction to lithium-ion battery and 2D electronics/optoelectronics in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 to 5 report the work we have done in lithium-ion battery and 2D electronics/optoelectronics. Chapter 6 discusses the future work in both Si anode direction and 2D material photodetector direction. \u2767 Chapter 2 reports the study of the lithiation behaviors of both porous Si nanoparticles and porous Si nanowires by in situ and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and compare them with solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires. The in situ TEM observation reveals that the critical fracture diameter of porous Si particles reaches up to 1.52 \u03bcm, which is much larger than the previously reported 150 nm for crystalline Si nanoparticles and 870 nm for amorphous Si nanoparticles. After full lithiation, solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires transform to crystalline Li\u2081\u2085Si\u2084 phase while porous Si nanoparticles and nanowires transform to amorphous Li\u2093Si phase, which is due to the effect of domain size on the stability of Li\u2081\u2085Si\u2084 as revealed by the first-principle molecular dynamic simulation. Ex situ TEM characterization is conducted to further investigate the structural evolution of porous and solid Si nanoparticles during the cycling process, which confirms that the porous Si nanoparticles exhibit better capability to suppress pore evolution than solid Si nanoparticles. The investigation of structural evolution and phase transition of porous Si nanoparticles and nanowires during the lithiation process reveal that they are more desirable as lithium-ion battery anode materials than solid Si nanoparticles and nanowires. \u2767 Chapter 3 reports our study on Si-S full cells. The challenges in the Si S full cell integration is discussed, and a failure mechanism of Si S full cell is proposed, which is due to the spontaneous reaction between Si (and lithiated Si) and polysulfides. On this basis, we report one prototype of Si S full cells using lithiated Nafion coated porous Si as anode and sulfur as cathode, and our study on the functionality of Nafion in shielding Si from reaction with polysulfides. With optimized mass ratio between sulfur and silicon, the full cell yields specific capacity of 330 mAh/g and energy density of 590 Wh/kg after 100 cycles based on the total mass of sulfur and silicon. The achieved energy density is more than 2 times higher than commercially available lithium ion batteries. The investigation of issues in Si S full cell research and the proposed full cell prototype will shed light on the development of next generation lithium ion batteries. \u2767 Chapter 4 reports the synthesis of low-cost hierarchical carbon-coated (HCC) Si using ball-milled Si as the starting material. The obtained particles prepared from different Si sources all show excellent cycling performance of over 1000 mAh/g after 1000 cycles. Interestingly, we observed in situ formation of porous Si and it is well confined in the carbon shell based on post-cycling characterization of the hierarchical carbon-coated metallurgical Si (HCC-M-Si) particles. In addition, lightweight and free-standing electrodes consisting of the HCC-M-Si particles and carbon nanofibers were fabricated, which achieved 1015 mAh/g after 100 cycles based on the total mass of the electrodes. Compared with conventional electrodes, the lightweight and free-standing electrodes significantly improve the energy density by 745%. Furthermore, LiCoO\u2082 and LiNi\u2080.\u2085Mn\u2081.\u2085O\u2084 cathodes were used to pair up with the HCC-M-Si anode to fabricate full cells. With LiNi\u2080.\u2085Mn\u2081.\u2085O\u2084 as cathode, energy density up to 547 Wh/kg was achieved by the high-voltage full cell. After 100 cycles, the full cell with LiNi\u2080.\u2085Mn\u2081.\u2085O\u2084 cathode delivers 46% more energy density than that of the full cell with LiCoO\u2082 cathode. The systematic investigation on low-cost Si anodes together with their applications in lightweight free-standing electrodes and high-voltage full cells will shed light on development of high-energy Si-based lithium-ion batteries for real applications. \u2767 Chapter 5 studies the novel 2D material black arsenic phosphorus (b-As\u2093P\u2081\u208b\u2093) formed by introducing arsenic into black phosphorus, which can significantly extend the operational wavelength range of photonic devices. The as-fabricated b-As\u2093P\u2081\u208b\u2093 photodetector sandwiched within hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) shows peak extrinsic responsivity of 190, 16, and 1.2 mA/W at 3.4, 5.0, and 7.7 \u03bcm at room temperature, respectively. Moreover, the intrinsic photoconductive effect dominates the photocurrent generation mechanism due to the preservation of pristine properties of b-As\u2093P\u2081\u208b\u2093 by complete hBN encapsulation and these b-As\u2093P\u2081\u208b\u2093 photodetectors exhibit negligible transport hysteresis. The broad and large photo-responsivity within mid-infrared resulting from the intrinsic photoconduction, together with the excellent long-term air stability, makes black arsenic phosphorus a promising alternative material for mid-infrared applications, such as free space communication, infrared imaging, and biomedical sensing. \u2767 Chapter 6 proposes future research topics. To avoid the capacity loss of Si-based lithium-ion batteries in the first lithiation process, synthesis of Li\u2093Si is highly desired. We propose a one-step large-scale synthesis method of Li\u2093Si, which produces Li\u2093Si and electrode slurry in a single step. Another research topic is Te photodetector. The application of black phosphorus and black arsenic phosphorus photodetector is limited because they are air-sensitive. As an air-stable two-dimensional material, Te also possesses similar electronic/optoelectronic properties as black phosphorus, which makes it promising candidate as medium-wavelength infrared photodetector. A systematic study of Te photodetector has been conducted and the underlying photocurrent generation mechanism is under investigation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-3625", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-3625", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

In this study, we synthesized 1,2,4-triazole and its 16 hydrazone derivatives (B1\u2013B16), characterized them by IR, NMR and Mass spectroscopy, and evaluated their radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and in vivo. Out of 16 derivatives, five (B1, B5, B6, B9, and B13) demonstrated a significant radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. B6, which possessed two electron-donating hydroxyl groups, was most active among all. Molecular docking and MD simulation of the complex of B6 with prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) or cyclooxygenase (COX) showed that B6 occupied celecoxib binding site in COX with high affinity (the binding free energy of the complex with COX-1 was \u201310.5, and \u201311.2 kcal/mol with COX-2). Maximum anti-inflammatory activity was also shown by the B6 derivative in vivo, in the rat model of carrageenan-induced inflammation. B6, along with four other derivatives (B1, B5, B9 and B13) exhibited 80\u201390% free radical scavenging activity. The IC50 values of these compounds were \u226540 \u00b5M. Griess nitrite and dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein-diacetate assays suggested a significant inhibition of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, especially by B6 and B9. Taken together, out of 16 derivatives, B6 is reported to have highest anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity at a low dose level, which may be attributed to its two electron-donating hydroxyls.

However, the trajectory of AM fungal diversity after land degradation is poorly known. We studied the succession of AM fungi along an agricultural recultivation chronosequence after open-cast mining near Cologne, Germany. We used high-throughput sequencing of the large-subunit ribosomal RNA genes to characterize the soil AM fungal communities of 10 agricultural fields spanning 52 years of recultivation. During three years, soils are recultivated with a legume, and then converted to agriculture to be later returned to local farmers implementing conventional agriculture. Our data reveal a quick and strong recovery of AM fungal richness after a few years of recultivation, but also a rapid decline following years of conventional agriculture.

Mesic tropical ecosystems were progressively restricted to the coasts and replaced by arid-adapted floral and faunal communities. Whilst the role of aridification has been investigated in a wide range of terrestrial lineages, the response of freshwater clades remains poorly investigated. To gain insights into the diversification processes underlying a freshwater radiation, we studied the evolutionary history of the Australasian predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Hydroporini (147 described species). We used an integrative approach including the latest methods in phylogenetics, divergence time estimation, ancestral character state reconstruction, and likelihood-based methods of diversification rate estimation. Phylogenies and dating analyses were reconstructed with molecular data from seven genes (mitochondrial and nuclear) for 117 species (plus 12 outgroups). Robust and well-resolved phylogenies indicate a late Oligocene origin of Australasian Hydroporini. Biogeographic analyses suggest an origin in the East Coast region of Australia, and a dynamic biogeographic scenario implying dispersal events. The group successfully colonized the tropical coastal regions carved by a rampant desertification, and also colonized groundwater ecosystems in Central Australia. Diversification rate analyses suggest that the ongoing aridification of Australia initiated in the Miocene contributed to a major wave of extinctions since the late Pliocene probably attributable to an increasing aridity, range contractions and seasonally disruptions resulting from Quaternary climatic changes. When comparing subterranean and epigean genera, our results show that contrasting mechanisms drove their diversification and therefore current diversity pattern. The Australasian Hydroporini radiation reflects a combination of processes that promoted both diversification, resulting from new ecological opportunities driven by initial aridification, and a subsequent loss of mesic adapted diversity due to increasing aridity.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.c5g23", "publicationDate": "2014-07-18", "dateAvailable": "2014-07-18", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c5g23", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The results showed that tianeptine quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA more efficiently than its esters due to the presence of the free acid portion. The number of binding sites determined by fluorescence spectroscopy is approximately equal to 1 indicating that there is one binding site between BSA tianeptine esters, but the presence of a second interaction site for tianeptine at higher temperatures could be not ruled out.

To examine whether heterologous expression of MDHAR from Oryza sativa (OsMDHAR) can prevent the deleterious effects of unfavorable growth conditions, we constructed a transgenic yeast strain harboring a recombinant plasmid carrying OsMDHAR (p426GPD::OsMDHAR). OsMDHAR-expressing yeast cells displayed enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide by maintaining redox homoeostasis, proteostasis, and the ascorbate (AsA)-like pool following the accumulation of antioxidant enzymes and molecules, metabolic enzymes, and molecular chaperones and their cofactors, compared to wild-type (WT) cells carrying vector alone. The addition of exogenous AsA or its analogue isoascorbic acid increased the viability of WT and ara2\u0394 cells under oxidative stress. Furthermore, the survival of OsMDHAR-expressing cells was greater than that of WT cells when cells at mid-log growth phase were exposed to high concentrations of ethanol. High OsMDHAR expression also improved the fermentative capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a standard cultivation temperature (30\u00b0C). The alcohol yield of OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast during fermentation was approximately 25% (0.18 g\u00b7g-1) higher than that of WT yeast. Accordingly, OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast showed prolonged survival during the environmental stresses produced during fermentation. These results suggest that heterologous OsMDHAR expression increases tolerance to reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves survival during fermentation, which enhances fermentative capacity.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.9bv73", "publicationDate": "2016-11-04", "dateAvailable": "2016-11-04", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9bv73", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

For cells to proliferate, the genome must be replicated exactly once per cell cycle in a timely and accurate manner. Making this task difficult are multiple other genomic processes, such as transcription and DNA repair, that are concurrently operating on the same genomic template. Replication initiates at specific loci called replication origins that must undergo a series of protein loadings before they can begin to replicate. Although this loading schedule takes place at all origins, individual origins fire at distinct and conserved times during S-phase.   It has been suggested that origin firing schedules are defined by their propensity to attract rate limiting replication factors from limited pools (where origins with higher propensities replicate earlier and origins with lower propensities replicate later). This model has not been validated and, furthermore, the factors determining an origin's propensity to attract replication factors remains poorly understood. In higher eukaryotes, replication timing has been linked to epigenetic inheritance and genomic stability. Thus, determining which factors dictate origin timing schedules is important for understanding the mechanisms driving development and healthy cell proliferation.; This current work investigates the molecular kinetics that drive the S. cerevisiae replication schedule and also begins to uncover what coordination they exhibit with concurrently operating genomic processes. To understand better these timing dynamics, we begin by developing molecular and computational tools to analyze replication timing genome-wide. Using these tools we produce a novel dataset that represents the highest fidelity temporal map of DNA replication to date. Next, to identify novel candidate limiting factors to DNA replication, we describe and analyze (in the context of this temporal map) two additional datasets designed to capture both pre-S-phase replication protein loading and global origin efficiencies.; Through analysis of these data we determine that, in G1-phase, the earliest replicating origins show a high propensity to attract Cdc45 (a replication factor that is limited in its nuclear concentration G1-phase). Following this, we devise and computationally implement a detailed theoretical model of DNA replication to test the hypothesis that origin firing dynamics (and hence genome-wide replication times) are determined by their ability to recruit replication factors from limited pools. After validating this model we identify factors that, in unperturbed cells, are correlated with origin firing dynamics. These include nucleosome positioning around the origin and the clustering of origins in the nucleus in late G1-phase.; Previous work has demonstrated that histone acetylation around an origin promotes its early replication. Specifically, others have shown that when the histone-deacetylase Rpd3 is removed from the cell several origins increase in their activity. To test the scope of Rpd3's action at origins, we have analyzed Rpd3 mutant cells genome-wide for their origin replication activities. We determined that approximately one-third of origins are suppressed by Rpd3 action. By targeting the individual complexes that Rpd3 operates in, we determined that its action at origins is through its role in transcriptional repression at the gene promoter, as opposed to its broad action as a suppressor of spurious transcription events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regions surrounding Rpd3-regulated origns are deacetylated by Rpd3 and also that these regions are enriched for Rpd3 binding and Rpd3-regulated genes.; Finally, we introduce the forkhead transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 as two novel regulators of origin function. We demonstrate that Fkh1 alone regulates ~50 origins and that in cells where both Fkh1 and Fkh2 action is removed, over one-half of all origins show deregulation. Furthermore, these factors are the first to be identified that have both repressive and excitatory action at origins (~100 origins are activated by Fkh1 and Fkh2 while ~80 are repressed; Fkh-excited and -repressed, respectively). As mentioned above, Cdc45 association at origins in G1-phase is predictive of their function. We demonstrate that in fkh1\u0394fkh2\u0394 cells, this factor is depleted at Fkh-excited origins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Fkh-excited origins are not found near the centromere, in contrast Fkh-repressed origins include many origins that localize at the centromere. Finally, we determine that Fkh1 and Fkh2 likely have their action at origins by regulating the formation of long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show evidence suggesting (that to regulate these interactions) individual forkhead proteins bind at different origins and then dimerize to bring these origins together in the nucleus.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3931", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3931", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The freshwater mussel-fish symbiosis represents a useful relationship for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics in freshwater ecosystems but the practicality of this promising model system is undermined by the absence of a stable freshwater mussel phylogeny. Inadequate character sampling is the primary analytical impediment obfuscating a coherent phylogeny of freshwater mussels, specifically the lack of nuclear molecular markers appropriate for reconstructing supraspecific relationships and testing macroevolutionary hypotheses. The objective of this study is to develop a phylogenomic resource, specifically an anchored hybrid enrichment probe set, capable of capturing hundreds of molecular markers from taxa distributed across the entirety of freshwater mussel biodiversity. Our freshwater mussel specific anchored hybrid enrichment probe set, called Unioverse, successfully captures hundreds of nuclear protein-coding loci from all major lineages of the Unionoida and will facilitate more data-rich and taxonomically inclusive reconstructions of freshwater mussel evolution. We demonstrate the utility of this resource at three disparate evolutionary scales by estimating a backbone phylogeny of the Bivalvia with a focus on the order Unionoida, reconstructing the subfamily-level relationships of the Unionidae, and recovering the systematic position of the phylogenetically unstable genus Plectomerus.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8575jr5", "publicationDate": "2019-02-25", "dateAvailable": "2019-02-25", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8575jr5", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Beyond their key role in defining taste and smell, flavor molecules also regulate metabolic processes with consequences to health. Such molecules present in natural sources have been an integral part of human history with limited success in attempts to create synthetic alternatives. Given their utility in various spheres of life such as food and fragrances, it is valuable to have a repository of flavor molecules, their natural sources, physicochemical properties, and sensory responses. FlavorDB (http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb) comprises of 25,595 flavor molecules representing an array of tastes and odors. Among these 2254 molecules are associated with 936 natural ingredients belonging to 34 categories. The dynamic, user-friendly interface of the resource facilitates exploration of flavor molecules for divergent applications: finding molecules matching a desired flavor or structure; exploring molecules of an ingredient; discovering novel food pairings; finding the molecular essence of food ingredients; associating chemical features with a flavor and more. Data-driven studies based on FlavorDB can pave the way for an improved understanding of flavor mechanisms.,The source of this description is the metadata record on FAIRsharing.org, an educational and informative resource that describes and links databases, standards, and data policies.

Observed dispersal rate (DO) values were estimated from time-calibrated molecular phylogenies in Lagrange+, a modified version of the ML-based parametric biogeographic program Lagrange. DO is measured in units of \u2018wallaces\u2019 (wa) as the number of biogeographic range-expansion events per million years. DO estimates were generated on a dynamic paleogeographic landscape of five areas over three time intervals from Upper Cretaceous to Recent. Expected dispersal rate (DE) values were generated from alternative paleogeographic models, with dispersal rates proportional to target area and source-river discharge volume, and inversely proportional to paleogeographic distance. Correlations between DO and DE were used to assess the relative contributions of these three biogeographic parameters. DO estimates imply a persistent dispersal corridor across the Eastern (Antillean) margin of the Caribbean plate, under the influence of prevailing and perennial riverine discharge vectors such as the Proto-Orinoco-Amazon (POA) river. Ancestral area estimation places the earliest colonizations of the Greater Antilles and Central America (GACA) during the Paleocene-Eocene (c. 58-45 Ma), potentially during the existence of an incomplete Paleogene Arc (~59 Ma) or Lesser Antilles Arc (~45 Ma), but predating the GAARlandia land bridge (~34-33 Ma). Paleogeographic distance is the single best predictor of DO. The Western (Central American) plate margin did not serve as a dispersal corridor until the Late Neogene (12-0 Ma), and contributed relatively little to the formation of modern distributions.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.11cv0", "publicationDate": "2015-10-28", "dateAvailable": "2015-10-28", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.11cv0", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In this way a container was selected for thermal applications in various applications such as dehydration, incubation, cell culture, refrigeration and sterilization of dry air.\nTo obtain the physical model it was necessary to use a container with a known volume that would allow adding sensors and maintaining a treatment space (St) for the products to be treated. Then, an important consideration was the need of a low cost system and finally any person or group, with a minimum knowledge base, could build that. For the demonstration prototype, temperature sensors were added to the actuators and to the internal and external dry air volumes, humidity sensors, pressure and electrical current.\nThe technique implemented is based on the digital data acquisition system, where the physical signal is acquired, converted to an electrical signal, filtered; the analog to digital conversion is carried out, and converted to text files. Three actuators were installed, which are necessary to cover the temperature ranges.

Furthermore, with Simulink the transfer function response curve without the regulation of the controller parameters, and then the resulting curve compared with the values P, I, D, after setting the PID values. The Sisotools software was used as a graphical tool to analyze the linear first order system. The controller gain is then modified to change the controller overshoot.\nThe data flow and state diagrams were modeled using the Stateflow software in order to compare the theoretical data with the real model and validate the design concept.

In this study, we investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using candidate gene approach from high- and low-fecundity populations of the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens St\u00e5l (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) divergently selected for fecundity. We also tested whether the population fecundity can be predicted by a few SNPs. Seven genes (ACE, fizzy, HMGCR, LpR, Sxl, Vg and VgR) were inspected for SNPs in N. lugens, which is a serious insect pest of rice. By direct sequencing of the complementary DNA and promoter sequences of these candidate genes, 1033 SNPs were discovered within high- and low-fecundity BPH populations. A panel of 121 candidate SNPs were selected and genotyped in 215 individuals from 2 laboratory populations (HFP and LFP) and 3 field populations (GZP, SGP and ZSP). Prior to association tests, population structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the 3 field populations were analyzed. The association results showed that 7 SNPs were significantly associated with population fecundity in BPH. These significant SNPs were used for constructing general liner models with stepwise regression. The best predictive model was composed of 2 SNPs (ACE-862 andVgR-816) with very good fitting degree. We found that 29% of the phenotypic variation in fecundity could be accounted for by only 2 markers. Using two laboratory populations and a complete independent field population, the predictive accuracy were 84.35%-92.39%. The predictive model provides an efficient molecular method to predict BPH fecundity of field populations and provides novel insights for insect population management.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.3j6t8", "publicationDate": "2015-01-08", "dateAvailable": "2015-01-08", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3j6t8", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

In the first part of the thesis, SFG has been used to elucidate the molecular orientation of methyl groups terminating Si(111). Both the symmetric and asymmetric stretches of the surface-bound methyl group showed a pronounced azimuthal anisotropy of the 3-fold symmetry in registry with the signal from the Si(111) substrate, indicating that the propeller-like rotation of the methyl groups was hindered at room temperature. The difference in the SFG line widths for the CH3 symmetric stretch that was observed for different polarization combinations (SPS and PPP for SFG, visible, and IR) indicated that the rotation proceeded on a 1-2 ps time scale, as compared to the ~100 fs rotational dephasing of a free methyl rotor at room temperature. The second part of this thesis describes a simple but general phenomenon observed in temporally-delayed SFG spectra. Depending on the magnitude of the delay, nearby vibrational resonances can flip their relative phase, i.e., appear either in- or out-of-phase with one another, resulting in either constructive or destructive interference in SFG spectra. This is significant for interpretation of the SFG spectra, in particular because the sign of the resonant amplitude provides the absolute molecular orientation (up versus down) of the vibrational chromophore. The third part of the thesis uses SFG to describe CO adsorption to gold surfaces at room temperature and pressure. In the presence of water, CO adsorption was significantly enhanced compared to if no water was present, indicating cooperativity in the CO adsorption behavior. Two CO adsorption peaks have been observed, indicating two different adsorption sites are present on the gold surface. In the last part of the thesis, heterodyne-detected SFG (HD-SFG) has been used to investigate hydrogen bonding at the air-water interface. Implementation of HD-SFG allowed to extract both the phase and amplitude of the spectroscopic signal, thus allowing to subtract the nonresonant (NR) background signal.

We conducted a 4-year capture\u2013recapture study to measure survival by genotype and phenotype in the Southwestern Fence Lizard (Sceloporus cowlesi) at the White Sands ecotone (transition area between white sands and dark soil habitats). We report several unanticipated findings. First, in contrast with previous work showing that cryptic blanched coloration in S. cowlesi from the heart of the dunes is associated with mutations in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r), ecotonal S. cowlesi showed minimal association between colour phenotype and Mc1r genotype. Second, the frequency of the derived Mc1r allele in ecotonal S. cowlesi appeared to decrease over time. Third, our capture\u2013recapture data revealed a lower survival rate for S. cowlesi individuals with the derived Mc1r allele. Thus, our results suggest that selection at the ecotone may have favoured the wild-type allele in recent years. Even in a system where a genotype\u2013phenotype association appeared to be black and white, our study suggests that additional factors \u2013 including phenotypic plasticity, epistasis, pleiotropy and gene flow \u2013 may play important roles at the White Sands ecotone. Our study highlights the importance of linking molecular, genomic and organismal approaches for understanding adaptation in the wild.

However, no traditional molecular techniques have been able to differentiate these 2 morphologically well-defined taxa from one another, or conclusively from the closely related Gilded Flicker (Colaptes chrysoides). Here, we use a next-generation sequencing approach to assess the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of these 3 taxa. We confirm the overall low levels of differentiation found using traditional molecular markers, but are able to distinguish between the 3 taxa for the first time, using a dataset of thousands of SNP loci distributed across the genome. Through demographic modeling and phylogenetic reconstructions, we find that Red-shafted and Yellow-shafted flickers are likely sister taxa, and that their divergence from the Gilded Flicker was comparatively older. The low level of divergence and lack of fixed differences in our dataset between Red-shafted and Yellow-shafted flickers, in particular, suggests whole-genome re-sequencing may be necessary to assess the dynamics of their hybridization and identify the genetic basis of their striking differences in plumage.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.4c57d0f", "publicationDate": "2018-06-12", "dateAvailable": "2018-06-12", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4c57d0f", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

These events are dependent on calcium entering the cell: high calcium influx activates the CaMKII pathway that leads to LTP, whereas low influx triggers the calcineurin pathway that leads to LTD. The outcome of these cascades is represented by phosphorylation of AMPA receptors, prevalent feature of LTP. This model represents the aforementioned biochemical mechanisms based on calcium concentrations and it is a simplified version of Li et al (2012)* model of synaptic plasticity. Additionally, it was extended by the addition of a pathway activated by glutamate binding to mGluR5 that leads to calcium-induced calcium release, through activation of IP3 receptors. This extended version better depicts calcium dynamics in the cell. Both models can be found as SBML files and they were originally created to run in COPASI software. Simulations can be run as time courses (here of 500 sec) or parameter scans for various molecular concentrations.

Members of the P. amabilis species complex represent invaluable germplasm for the breeding program. However, the phylogeny of the P. amabilis species complex is still uncertain. The Phalaenopsis amabilis species complex (Orchidaceae) consists of subspecies amabilis, moluccana, and rosenstromii of P. amabilis, as well as P. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite, P. ap. ssp. formosana, and P. sanderiana. The aims of this study were to reconstruct the phylogeny and biogeographcial patterns of the species complex using Neighbor Joining (NJ), Maxinum Parsimony (MP), Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) and Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies (RASP) analyses based on sequences of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 from the nuclear ribosomal DNA and the trnH-psbA spacer from the plastid DNA. Results: A pattern of vicariance, dispersal, and vicariance\u2009+\u2009dispersal among disjunctly distributed taxa was uncovered based on RASP analysis. Although two subspecies of P. aphrodite could not be differentiated from each other in dispersal state, they were distinct from P. amabilis and P. sanderiana. Within P. amabilis, three subspecies were separated phylogenetically, in agreement with the vicariance or vicariance\u2009+\u2009dispersal scenario, with geographic subdivision along Huxley\u2019s, Wallace\u2019s and Lydekker\u2019s Lines. Molecular dating revealed such subdivisions among taxa of P. amabilis complex dating back to the late Pleistocene. Population-dynamic analyses using a Bayesian skyline plot suggested that the species complex experienced an in situ range expansion and population concentration during the late Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Conclusions: Taxa of the P. amabilis complex with disjunct distributions were differentiated due to vicariance or vicariance\u2009+\u2009dispersal, with events likely occurring in the late Pleistocene. Demographic growth associated with the climatic oscillations in the W\u00fcrm glacial period followed the species splits. Nevertheless, a subsequent population slowdown occurred in the late LGM due to extinction of regional populations. The reduction of suitable habitats resulted in geographic fragmenttation of the remaining taxa.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.f8j12", "publicationDate": "2015-08-27", "dateAvailable": "2015-08-27", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f8j12", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Although retrotransposons are usually repressed, they become active in several human cancers, in particular those of the gastrointestinal tract. Here we characterize retrotransposon insertions in 202 colorectal tumor whole genomes and investigate their associations with molecular and clinical characteristics. We find highly variable retrotransposon activity among tumors and identify recurrent insertions in 15 known cancer genes. In approximately 1% of the cases we identify insertions in APC, likely to be tumor-initiating events. Insertions are positively associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype and the genomic fraction of allelic imbalance. Clinically, high number of insertions is independently associated with poor disease-specific survival.\n\nSample description: \n\nA signed informed consent was obtained for as many human participants as possible.

Optimization of conservation strategies for these endangered marine top predators requires direct estimates of breeding patterns and connectivity, which are essential to understand their population dynamics. While there have been some attempts to investigate breeding patterns of reef sharks from litter reconstruction using molecular analyses, direct fine-scale migrations of female sharks for parturition as well as connectivity at a medium scale, such as between islands, remain mostly unknown. We used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to determine breeding patterns of female blacktip reef sharks in Moorea (Society Islands, French Polynesia). Such an approach demonstrates that while most females gave birth at their home island, some migrated to specific nursery areas outside their home range, sometimes going to another island (up to 50 km across deep ocean). Analysis also revealed that females migrated to the same nursery on every birthing event. Many offspring showed a high level of inbreeding indicating an overall reduced population size, restricted movements and dispersal, or specific mating behaviour. Females represent the vectors that transport the genes at nursery grounds, and their fidelity should thus define reproductive units. As females seem to be philopatric, males could be the ones dispersing genes between metapopulations. These results highlight the need for conservation of coastal zones where female reef sharks seems to exhibit philopatry during the breeding season.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.gk7nh", "publicationDate": "2012-10-11", "dateAvailable": "2012-10-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gk7nh", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The dual subgradient method, also known as the dual ascent method, and the primal dual subgradient method, also known as the Arrow-Hurwicz-Uzawa subgradient method, are classical Lagrangian methods to solve constrained convex programs. Both methods are known to have a slow O(1\u2215\u03b5\u00b2) convergence time. In contrast, the new Lagrangian methods proposed in this thesis have a faster O(1\u2215\u03b5) convergence time. Recall that the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is another representative Lagrangian method for convex programs with linear equality constraints, is also known to have O(1\u2215\u03b5) convergence. However, our methods work for general convex programs with possibly non-linear constraints. \u2767 We first revisit the classical dual subgradient method and study its convergence time for constrained strongly convex programs in Chapter 2. By using a novel drift-plus-penalty type analysis, we show that the dual subgradient method enjoys a faster O(1\u2215\u03b5) convergence time for general (possibly non-differentiable) constrained strongly convex programs. After that, we seek to develop new Lagrangian methods with the fast O(1\u2215\u03b5) convergence time for general constrained convex programs without strong convexity in Chapter 3, which is the core chapter in this thesis. Based on the new Lagrangian methods developed in Chapter 3, new techniques that exceed the state-of-the-art are developed for joint rate control and routing in data networks in Chapter 4 and for online convex optimization with stochastic and long term constraints in Chapters 5-6. \u2767 The other focus of this thesis is to illustrate the practical relevance of mathematical optimization techniques in engineering systems. In Chapter 7, we adapt our new online convex optimization technique to the power control for energy harvesting devices with outdated state information such that we can achieve utility within O(\u03b5) of the optimal by using a battery with an O(1\u2215\u03b5) capacity. In Chapter 8, we extend conventional drift-plus-penalty stochastic optimization and Zinkevich's online convex optimization to develop new dynamic transmit covariance design policies for MIMO fading systems with unknown channel distributions and inaccurate channel state information. In Chapter 9, we study the index coding problem and characterize the optimality of two representative scalar and fractional linear codes, i.e., cyclic codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, by studying the integrality gap between the integer linear program from an information theoretical lower bound and its linear relaxations and the Lagrangian duality between various linear relaxations and their dual problems.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-470444", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-470444", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an omics scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. Ensembler takes any set of sequences\u2014from a single sequence to an entire superfamily\u2014and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant PDB structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. Ensembler thus automates much of the time-consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics\u2014such as Markov state models (MSMs)\u2014which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates.

After &gt;20 years of intensive usage, the extent of mitochondrial evolutionary rate variations across species, their practical consequences on sequence analysis methods, and the ultimate reasons for mtDNA hypermutability are still largely unresolved issues. Using an extensive cytochrome b data set, fossil data, and taking advantage of the decoupled dynamics of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, we measure the lineage-specific mitochondrial mutation rate across 1,696 mammalian species and compare it with the nuclear rate. We report an unexpected 2 orders of magnitude mitochondrial mutation rate variation between lineages: cytochrome b third codon positions are renewed every 1-2 Myr, in average, in the fastest evolving mammals, whereas it takes &gt;100 Myr in slow-evolving lineages. This result has obvious implications in the fields of molecular phylogeny, molecular dating, and population genetics. Variations of mitochondrial substitution rate across species are partly explained by body mass, longevity, and age of female sexual maturity. The classical metabolic rate and generation time hypothesis, however, do not fully explain the observed patterns, especially a stronger effect of longevity in long-lived than in short-lived species. We propose that natural selection tends to decrease the mitochondrial mutation rate in long-lived species, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of aging.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.82181", "publicationDate": "2013-02-11", "dateAvailable": "2013-02-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.82181", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, phylogenomic and comparative genomic studies have also suggested that tunicates are characterized by an elevated rate of molecular evolution and a high degree of genomic divergence. Despite the recurrent interest in the group, the picture of tunicate peculiar evolutionary dynamics is still fragmentary, as it mainly lies in studies focusing on only a few model species. In order to expand the available genomic data for the group, we used the high-throughput 454 technology to sequence the partial transcriptome of a previously unsampled tunicate, Microcosmus squamiger. This allowed us to get further insights into tunicate-accelerated evolution through a comparative analysis based on pertinent phylogenetic markers, i.e., a core of 35 housekeeping genes conserved across bilaterians. Our results showed that tunicates evolved on average about two times faster than the other chordates, yet the degree of this acceleration varied extensively upon genes and upon lineages. Appendicularia and Aplousobranchia were detected as the most divergent groups which were also characterized by highly heterogeneous substitution rates across genes. Finally, an estimation of the d (N)/d (S) ratio in three pairs of closely related taxa within Olfactores did not reveal strong differences between the tunicate and vertebrate lineages suggesting that for this set of housekeeping genes, the accelerated evolution of tunicates is plausibly due to an elevated mutation rate rather than to particular selective effects.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8323", "publicationDate": "2011-01-14", "dateAvailable": "2011-01-14", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8323", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We evaluated the roles of gene flow in the geographically structured processes of a predator\u2013prey arms race involving a seed-predatory weevil with a long mouthpart and its host camellia plant with a thick fruit coat. Molecular genetic analyses showed that both weevil and camellia populations were structured at a spatial scale of several kilometers. Importantly, the spatial pattern of the migration of weevils, but not that of camellias, imposed significant effects on the geographic configuration of the levels of coevolutionary escalation. This result suggests that even if migration is limited in one species (camellia), local coevolution with the other species that migrates between neighboring localities (weevil) can reduce the inter-population difference in the local adaptive optima of the former species. Thus, gene flow of a species potentially homogenizes local biological environments provided by the species and thereby promotes the evolutionary convergence of its coevolving counterparts. Consequently, by focusing on coevolutionary interactions in natural communities, \u201cindirect\u201d effects of gene flow on the adaptive divergence of organisms could be identified.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8469", "publicationDate": "2011-01-28", "dateAvailable": "2011-01-28", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8469", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Where population dynamics show negative density-dependence, suppression can be enhanced if lethality occurs after the density-dependent (i.e. larval) stage. Existing molecular tools have limited current examples of such Genetic Pest Management (GPM) systems to achieving this through engineering \u2018cell-autonomous effectors\u2019 i.e. where the expressed deleterious protein is restricted to the cells in which it is expressed \u2013 usually under the control of the regulatory elements (e.g. promoter regions) used to build the system. This limits the flexibility of these technologies as regulatory regions with useful spatial, temporal or sex-specific expression patterns may only be employed if the cells they direct expression in are simultaneously sensitive to existing effectors, and also precludes the targeting of extracellular regions such as cell-surface receptors. Expanding the toolset to \u2018non-cell autonomous\u2019 effectors would significantly reduce these limitations.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We sought to engineer female-specific, late-acting lethality through employing the Ae. aegypti VitellogeninA1 promoter to drive blood-meal-inducible, fat-body specific expression of tTAV. Initial attempts using pro-apoptotic effectors gave no evident phenotype, potentially due to the lower sensitivity of terminally-differentiated fat-body cells to programmed-death signals. Subsequently, we dissociated the temporal and spatial expression of this system by engineering a novel synthetic effector (Scorpion neurotoxin \u2013 TetO-gp67.AaHIT) designed to be secreted out of the tissue in which it was expressed (fat-body) and then affect cells elsewhere (neuro-muscular junctions). This resulted in a striking, temporary-paralysis phenotype after blood-feeding. \n\nConclusions/Significance: These results are significant in demonstrating for the first time an engineered \u2018action at a distance\u2019 phenotype in a non-model pest insect. The potential to dissociate temporal and spatial expression patterns of useful endogenous regulatory elements will extend to a variety of other pest insects and effectors.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.25pp406", "publicationDate": "2019-08-05", "dateAvailable": "2019-08-05", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.25pp406", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, such escape mutations may exact a fitness cost due to impaired protein function. Here, it is hypothesised that the recurring generation of specific neutralising antibodies to an epitope region as it evolves in response to antibody selection will cause amino acid reversions by releasing early escape mutations from immune selection. The plausibility of this hypothesis was tested with stochastic simulation of adaptation at the molecular sequence level in finite populations. Under the conditions of strong selection and weak mutation, the rates of allele fixation and amino acid reversion increased with population size and selection coefficients. These rates decreased with population size, however, if mutation became strong, because clonal interference reduced the rate of adaptation. The model successfully predicts the rate of reversion per allele fixation for an important human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibody epitope region.

Relativistic effects become increasingly important for the heavier group-V hydrides and can be manifest in studies of the photodissociation dynamics.; High-n Rydberg time-of-flight (HRTOF) spectroscopy has been used to study the 193.3 nm photolysis of AsH\u2083. The center-of-mass (c.m.) translational energy distribution for the one-photon process, AsH\u2083 + hv \u2192 AsH\u2082 + H, P(Ec.m.), indicates that AsH\u2082 internal excitation accounts for ~ 64% of the available energy [i.e., hv \u2013 D0(H\u2082As-H)]. Secondary AsH\u2082 photodissociation also takes place. Analyses of superimposed structure atop the broad P(Ec.m.) distribution suggest that AsH\u2082 is formed with significant a-axis rotation as well as bending excitation. Comparison of the results obtained with AsH\u2083 versus those of the lighter group-V hydrides (NH\u2083, PH\u2083) lends support to the proposed mechanisms. Of the group-V hydrides, AsH\u2083 lies intermediate between the nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes, requiring high-level electronic structure theory.; The room temperature absorption spectrum of SbH\u2083 has been recorded. The absorption spectrum is a broad continuum with no discernible structure; however, a long-wavelength tail is evident. The HRTOF technique has also been used to investigate the photodissociation dynamics of SbH\u2083 following 193.3 nm photolysis. The overall shapes of the translational energy distributions were inconsistent, precluding confident analysis. In spite of this, it is apparent that SbH\u2082 products are formed with substantial internal excitation and secondary photodissociation occurs.

Using 10 populations from each continent grown in a common environment, we identified several growth and defense traits that have diverged, despite low neutral genetic differentiation between continents. We next developed a Bayesian modeling approach to account for relationships between molecular and phenotypic differences, confirming that continental trait differentiation was greater than expected from neutral genetic differentiation. We found evidence that growth-related traits adaptively diverged within and between continents. Inducible defenses triggered by monarch butterfly herbivory were substantially reduced in European populations, and this reduction in inducibility was concordant with altered phytohormonal dynamics, reduced plant growth, and a trade-off with constitutive investment.

This approach differs from the standard Fst in that it can accommodate genetic similarity between individuals in a general form. We apply this strategy to complete genome data from 47 wild and domestic pigs from Asia and Europe. When we partitioned the total genomic variance into components associated to subsets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defined in terms of their annotation, we found that potentially deleterious non-synonymous mutations (9566 SNPs) explained as much genetic variance as the whole set of 25 million SNPs. This suggests that domestication may have affected protein sequence to a larger extent than regulatory or other kinds of mutations. A pathway-guided analysis revealed ovarian steroidogenesis and leptin signaling as highly relevant in domestication. The genomic regression approach proposed in this study revealed molecular processes not apparent through typical differentiation statistics. We propose that at least some of these processes are likely new discoveries because domestication is a dynamic process of genetic selection, which may not be completely characterized by a static metric like Fst. Nevertheless, and despite some particularly influential mutation types or pathways, our analyses tend to rule out a simplistic genetic basis for the domestication process: neither a single pathway nor a unique set of SNPs can explain the process as a whole.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.r6t26", "publicationDate": "2016-07-11", "dateAvailable": "2016-07-11", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r6t26", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Although the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance is well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms linking the genetic basis of resistance to its fitness cost remain poorly characterized. Here, we examine how the system-wide impacts of mutations in the RNA polymerase (RNAP) gene rpoB shape the fitness cost of rifampin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rifampin resistance mutations reduce transcriptional efficiency, and this explains 76% of the variation in fitness among rpoB mutants. The pleiotropic consequence of rpoB mutations is that mutants show altered relative transcript levels of essential genes. We find no evidence that global transcriptional responses have an impact on the fitness cost of rifampin resistance as revealed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Global changes in the transcriptional profiles of rpoB mutants compared to the transcriptional profile of the rifampin-sensitive ancestral strain are subtle, demonstrating that the transcriptional regulatory network of P. aeruginosa is robust to the decreased transcriptional efficiency associated with rpoB mutations. On a smaller scale, we find that rifampin resistance mutations increase the expression of RNAP due to decreased termination at an attenuator upstream from rpoB, and we argue that this helps to minimize the cost of rifampin resistance by buffering against reduced RNAP activity. In summary, our study shows that it is possible to dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning variation in the cost of rifampin resistance and highlights the importance of genome-wide buffering of relative transcript levels in providing robustness against resistance mutations.\n\nIMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance mutations carry fitness costs. Relative to the characteristics of their antibiotic-sensitive ancestors, resistant mutants show reduced growth rates and competitive abilities. Fitness cost plays an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the absence of antibiotics; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these fitness costs is not well understood. We applied a systems-level approach to dissect the molecular underpinnings of the fitness costs associated with rifampin resistance in P. aeruginosa and showed that most of the variation in fitness cost can be explained by the direct effect of resistance mutations on the enzymatic activity of the mutated gene. Pleiotropic changes in transcriptional profiles are subtle at a genome-wide scale, suggesting that the gene regulatory network of P. aeruginosa is robust in the face of the direct effects of resistance mutations.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.vj35n", "publicationDate": "2014-12-09", "dateAvailable": "2014-12-09", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vj35n", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

I purified them using Inverse Transition Cycling which has alternate rounds of hot spin and cold spin and their purity was confirmed through SDS-PAGE. \u2767 They were characterized using UV-Vis Spectrophotometry to measure their transition temperatures. Dynamic Light Scattering was used to measure their hydrodynamic radius and their ability to form a nano-sized micelle. Mass spectrometry was used to measure their molecular weight. These properties of these fusion proteins were then compared to S48I48, the backbone without targeting ligands. \u2767 To explore their trafficking in cells expressing pIgR, diblock ELP fusion proteins were labeled with Rhodamine dye. From confocal fluorescence microscopy, it was observed that Hex-S48I48, although it does not form nanoparticles, shows good cellular uptake. Though dmIgA formed nanosized micelles, their cellular uptake was not optimum.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-38631", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-38631", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Over the last decade, nuclear introns have been proposed as alternative markers for phylogenetic reconstruction. However, the resolution capabilities of mtDNA and nuclear introns have rarely been quantified and compared. In the current study we generated a novel \u223c5 kb dataset comprising six nuclear introns and a mtDNA fragment. We assessed the relative resolution capabilities of the six intronic fragments with respect to each other, when used in various combinations together, and when compared to the traditionally used mtDNA. We focused on a major clade in the horseshoe bat family (Afro-Palaearctic clade; Rhinolophidae) as our case study. This old, widely distributed and speciose group contains a high level of conserved morphology. This morphological stasis renders the reconstruction of the phylogeny of this group with traditional morphological characters complex. We sampled multiple individuals per species to represent their geographic distributions as best as possible (122 individuals, 24 species, 68 localities). We reconstructed the species phylogeny using several complementary methods (partitioned Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian and Bayesian multispecies-coalescent) and made inferences based on consensus across these methods. We computed pairwise comparisons based on Robinson\u2013Foulds tree distance metric between all Bayesian topologies generated (27,000) for every gene(s) and visualised the tree space using multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots. Using our supported species phylogeny we estimated the ancestral state of key traits of interest within this group, e.g. echolocation peak frequency which has been implicated in speciation. Our results revealed many potential cryptic species within this group, even in taxa where this was not suspected a priori and also found evidence for mtDNA introgression. We demonstrated that by using just two introns one can recover a better supported species tree than when using the mtDNA alone, despite the shorter overall length of the combined introns. Additionally, when combining any single intron with mtDNA, we showed that the result is highly similar to the mtDNA gene tree and far from the true species tree and therefore this approach should be avoided. We caution against the indiscriminate use of mtDNA in phylogenetic studies and advocate for pilot studies to select nuclear introns. The selection of marker type and number is a crucial step that is best based on critical examination of preliminary or previously published data. Based on our findings and previous publications, we recommend the following markers to recover phylogenetic relationships between recently diverged taxa (&lt;20 My) in bats and other mammals: ACOX2, COPS7A, BGN, ROGDI and STAT5A.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.s630c", "publicationDate": "2016-02-04", "dateAvailable": "2016-02-04", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s630c", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Using marine bivalves as a model system, and drawing on other systems where possible, we review paleobiologic and biogeographic support for two supposedly opposing views, that the LDG is shaped primarily by (a) local environmental factors that determine the number of species and higher taxa at a given latitude (in-situ hypotheses), or (b) the entry of lineages arising elsewhere into a focal region (spatial-dynamics hypotheses). Support for (a) includes the fit of present-day diversity trends in many clades to environmental factors such as temperature, and the correlation of extinction intensities in Pliocene bivalve faunas with net regional temperature changes. Support for (b) includes the age-frequency distribution of bivalve genera across latitudes, which is consistent with an out-of-the-tropics dynamic, as are the higher species diversities in temperate southeast Australia and southern Japan than in the tropical Caribbean. Thus, both in-situ and spatial-dynamics processes must shape the bivalve LDG, and are likely to operate in other groups as well. The relative strengths of the two processes may differ among groups showing similar LDGs, but dissecting their effects will require improved methods of integrating fossil data with molecular phylogenies. We highlight several potential research directions, and argue that many of the most dramatic biotic patterns, past and present, are likely to have been generated by diverse, mutually reinforcing drivers.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.qd53c", "publicationDate": "2016-11-07", "dateAvailable": "2016-11-07", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qd53c", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Porosity parameters can modify the scaffold hydrophilicity and permeability that in turn regulate the protein adsorption, cellular attachment and infiltration, and vascularization of the scaffold. Various methods have been investigated for control of porosity parameters; however, the field still suffers from major controversies and challenges; i.e., inability to customize the porosity and hydrophilicity at different levels. Therefore, considering the biomimetic strategies in replicating the natural tissue, this study explored a new integrated approach for control of porosity within nanocomposite collagen/nano-biphasic calcium phosphate (collagen/nBCP) scaffold. For this purpose, the ability of \u201cTPGS (vitamin E) as a potent biocompatible porogen was explored during a modified freeze-drying procedure. Several processing variables were studied in parallel in controlling the porosity parameters including; different quenching rates (-18 \u2103, -80 \u2103, and -196 \u2103), collagen/nBCP ratios (92/8% and 85/15%), and TPGS ratios (5% and 15%). The physicochemical characteristics of the scaffold were studied using different techniques with a particular focus on porosimetry analysis. The results showed that careful control of TPGS and quenching rate could increase the range of pore size and actively modify the pore shape, while collagen/nBCP ratio mostly affected total porosity and roughness. The collagen/nBCP ratio of 92/8% with TPGS treated at the quenching rate of -80 \u2103 showed more favorable and consistent physicochemical behaviors, i.e., higher porosity and hydrophilicity. This method allowed production of scaffold displaying multimodal heterogeneous pore distribution with an increase in the range of pore size of mostly round/oval pore morphology (similar to natural bone) and a high hydrophilicity that supported a better cellular performance. Considering the various medical benefits of TPGS, its careful application as surfactant-porogen tailored with its therapeutic potentials could provide a promising insight for production of customized scaffold for various tissue engineering applications. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to fully explore the potential of this integrated approach.", "doi": "10.17632/gfwtzygf9c.1", "publicationDate": "2019-07-02", "dateAvailable": "2019-07-02", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gfwtzygf9c", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Recently, several studies focused on the use of genomes to gain information about past ecological conditions. Several used the property that the G+C and amino-acid contents of bacterial and archaeal rDNA genes and proteins, respectively, are strongly influenced by the environmental temperature. The adaptation to optimal growth temperature (OGT) since the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) over the universal tree of life was examined and it was concluded that LUCA was likely to have been a mesophilic organism and that a parallel adaptation to high temperature occurred independently along the two lineages leading to the ancestors of Bacteria on one side and of Archaea+Eukarya on the other side. Here, we focus on Archaea to gain a precise view of the adaptation to OGT over time in this domain. It has been often proposed on the basis of indirect evidence that the last archaeal common ancestor was a hyperthermophilic organism. Moreover, many results showed the influence of environmental temperature on the evolutionary dynamics of archaeal genomes: thermophilic organisms generally display lower evolutionary rates than mesophiles. However, to our knowledge, no study tried to explain the differences of evolutionary rates for the entire archaeal domain and to investigate the evolution of substitution rates over time. A comprehensive archaeal phylogeny and a non\u2010homogeneous model of the molecular evolutionary process allowed us to estimate ancestral base and amino acid compositions and optimal growth temperatures at each internal node of the archaeal phylogenetic tree. The last archaeal common ancestor is predicted to have been hyperthermophilic and adaptations to cooler environments can be observed for extant mesophilic species. Furthermore, mesophilic species present both long branches and high variation of nucleotide and amino acid compositions since the last archaeal common ancestor. The increase of substitution rates observed in mesophilic lineages along all their branches can be interpreted as an ongoing adaptation to colder temperatures and to new metabolisms. We conclude that environmental temperature is a major factor that governs evolutionary rates in Archaea.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.8976", "publicationDate": "2011-03-28", "dateAvailable": "2011-03-28", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8976", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Using transverse field \u03bc+SR we are able to identify characteristic behaviour in each of the regions of the phase diagram of the x=0 strong-rung spin ladder system (Hpip)2CuBr4. Comparison of our results to those of the dimer-based molecular magnet Cu(pyz)(gly)(ClO4) shows several common features. We locate the crossovers in partially disordered (Hpip)2CuBr4(1\u2212x)Cl4x (x=0.05), where a region of behaviour intermediate between quantum disordered and Luttinger liquid-like is identified. Our interpretation of the results incorporates an analysis of the probable muon stopping states in (Hpip)2CuBr4 based on density functional calculations and suggests how the muon plus its local distortion can lead to a local probe unit with good sensitivity to the magnetic state. Using longitudinal field \u03bc+SR we compare the dynamic response of the x=1 strong-rung material (Hpip)2CuCl4 to that of the strong-leg material (C7H10N)2CuBr4 (known as DIMPY) and demonstrate that our results are in agreement with predictions based on interacting fermionic quasiparticle excitations in these materials.,Muon-spin spectroscopy,Density functional theory,", "doi": "10.15128/r11r66j1142", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC)", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.15128%2Fr11r66j1142", "method": null, "source": "bl.durham", "type_cont": null},

The application of molecular phylogenetic techniques has identified the origins of numerous allopolyploids, but little is known on genomic and chromosomal consequences of allopolyploidization, despite their important role in conferring divergence of allopolyploids from their parental species. Here, using several plastid and nuclear sequence markers, we clarify the origin of tetra- and hexaploids in a group of American daisies, allowing characterization of genome dynamics in polyploids compared to their diploid ancestors. All polyploid species are allopolyploids. Among the four diploid gene pools, the propensity for allopolyploidization is unevenly distributed phylogenetically with a few species apparently more prone to participate, but the underlying causes remain unclear. Polyploid genomes are characterized by differential loss of ribosomal DNA loci (5S and 35S rDNA), known hotspots of chromosomal evolution, but show genome size additivity, suggesting limited changes beyond those affecting rDNA loci or the presence of processes counterbalancing genome reduction. Patterns of rDNA sequence conversion and provenance of the lost loci are highly idiosyncratic and differ even between allopolyploids of identical parentage, indicating that allopolyploids deriving from the same lower-ploid parental species can follow different evolutionary trajectories.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.3n148", "publicationDate": "2011-07-13", "dateAvailable": "2011-07-13", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3n148", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Absorption to the structureless 3s Rydberg state begins at 19,600 cm-1, though no REMPI spectrum is observed due to the fast predissociative nature of the state.  Instead, the onset is detected using photofragment spectroscopy of H and D atoms.  The electronic transition has a perpendicular transition moment, analogous to CH2OH.  The onset of the predissociative 3pz state can be detected via REMPI, and is observed at 32360 cm-1.  Photofragments detected from dissociation of this state show no recoil anisotropy.  However, the \u03b2 parameter becomes more negative (indicative of a perpendicular electronic transition moment) as the excitation energy is decreased.  The transition becomes more anisotropic as the energy decreases through the predicted region of the 3px Rydberg state towards the onset of the 3s state.  The onset of the transition to the 3px state cannot be identified due to the large background signal from the 3s state.  The translational energy distributions of H and D atims indicates that both the O-H(D) and C(2)-H(D) bonds can be broken at sufficiently high energies.; The ground state photodissociation dynamics of CD2CD2OH radical were studied to determine product branching ratios and look for evidence of vinyl alcohol (CD2CDOH) product.  Deuterated 2-hydroxyethyl radical (CD2CD2OH) was generated from photodissociation of the BrCD2CD2OH precursor by cleaving the Br-C bond at the wavelengths 202, 205, 210, and 215 nm.  The energy left in the CD2CD2OH radical after breaking this bond led to the spontaneous dissociation of the radical.  The presence of acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol products was inferred by monitoring the velocity distribution of the D atom co-fragment in the dissociation, and using conservation of energy to determine the identity of the molecular fragment.  Different photolysis wavelengths were used to determine whether an obvious change in branching ratio between D and OH dissociation products would become evident as less energy for dissociation became available to the system.  No precipitous drop in D products was seen toward longer photolysis wavelengths.  However, a high velocity tail became apparent at longer wavelengths, indicating the onset of 2-photon processes at these energies.  These processes are proposed to be owed to two phenomena:  an absorption by the radical beginning at 210 nm, and lengthening of the lifetime of the excited radical as the available energy above the centrifugal barrier becomes smaller.; Both acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol products were seen in the dissociation of CD2CD2OH.  In agreement with RRKM calculations, vinyl alcohol products are expected to constitute the majority of the dissociations to D + molecular co-fragment.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3380", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3380", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

In a replicated greenhouse experiment with the aquatic microbial community that inhabits the cup-shaped leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea, we monitored O2 levels and the concentration of bovine serum album (BSA), an effective molecular substitute for detritus. Low BSA enrichment rates triggered a classic hysteresis response, a substantial lag in the return of O2 levels. At intermediate BSA enrichment rates, O2 levels closely tracked BSA concentrations during both the enrichment and recovery phases. High BSA enrichment rates induced an unusual \"anti-clockwise\" hysteresis in which O2 levels were higher during the recovery phase than during the enrichment phase. These experiments revealed complex dynamic behavior in response to enrichment rates of a single environmental driver. Our results suggest that the past trajectory of enrichment is critical for understanding how systems will respond to restoration initiatives.

Effects of the ratios of phosphatidyl choline (PC) and surfactant, types of surfactants and lipid content on DL for the most appropriate formulation were investigated. The deoxyribose assay demonstrated the capability of scavenging hydroxyl radical of sericin with IC\u2085\u2080 at 0.9 mg/ml. It was found that the formation of DL could be achieved by reverse phase evaporation method and obtained large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). The optimum formulation comprised of 2% PC, Span 80 as surfactant and the ratio of PC:Span 80 as 85:15 by weight. Entrapment efficiency was 89.84\u00b12.87%. Size and size distribution determined by dynamic light scattering technique was 240 nm and span 3.088. Teh formulation of serum with DL loaded with silk sericin was carried out with types of viscosity enhancers: Carbopol ultrez-10, Poloxamer 407 and chitosan (high molecular weight). The results of physical stability test by heating and cooling method for 6 cycles revealed that the appropriate viscosity enhancer was 0.5% Carbopol ultrez-10, which was mixed with DL. Afterwards, skin permeation study using newborn abdominal pig skin as skin model revealed that deformable liposomes and conventional liposomes (CL) loaded with sericin could enhance the skin penetration of sericin through pig skin as compared with sericin solution which showed no permeation. It was demonstrated that DL and CL could enhance the delivery of sericin through skin. In the formulation of DL loaded with sericin containing in serum, sericin permeated through skin slower, but the permeability coefficient was significantly higher than DL without containing in serum (P &lt; 0.05)", "doi": "10.14457/cu.the.2007.1512", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.14457%2Fcu.the.2007.1512", "method": null, "source": "nrct.db1", "type_cont": null},

This reciprocal translocation causes a constitutively-activated tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL fusion gene. By comparing imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cell models, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which tetrahydrobenzimidazole derivative TMQ0153 triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis at low concentrations accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and increase of cytosolic free Ca2+ levels. Interestingly, at higher concentrations, TMQ0153 induced necroptotic cell death with accumulation of ROS, both preventable by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment. At necroptosis-inducing concentrations, we observed increased ROS and decreased ATP and GSH levels, concomitant with protective autophagy induction. Inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 (baf-A1) and siRNA against beclin 1 abrogated autophagy, sensitized CML cells against TMQ0153 and enhanced necroptotic cell death. Importantly, TMQ153-induced necrosis led to cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT) and ERp57 as well as the release of extracellular ATP and high mobility group box (HMGB1) demonstrating the immunological cell death markers by TMQ0153. We validated the anti-cancer potential of TMQ0153 by in vivo inhibition of K562 microtumor formation in zebrafish. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that cellular stress and redox modulation by TMQ0153 concentration-dependently leads to different cell death modalities including controlled necrosis in CML cell models.\n\nConclusion: Our findings indicate that TMQ0153-induced ROS act as a rheostat determining the onset of apoptotic- or autophagy-related controlled necrotic cell death in CML.\n", "doi": "10.17632/htg4vdkmvv.5", "publicationDate": "2019-12-14", "dateAvailable": "2019-12-14", "version": "5", "accessRights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/htg4vdkmvv", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

In the United States its victims are primarily the poor, foreign immigrants, and persons with AIDS. Efforts to control the disease are severely handicapped by the effects of social stigma and further compounded by issues of race, social class, ethnic stereotypes, immigrant status, and HIV coinfection. The study investigated the social dynamics of stigma in relation to TB in two populations particularly affected by all of these issues, Haitians in the United States and in Haiti. The theoretical framework of the study was cultural epidemiology, which combines quantitative and qualitative measures to study experience, meaning, and behavior in subpopulations of interest. The study design enabled important comparisons across national settings that highlight the differential effects of political-economic context, differences in stigma dynamics for active disease compared to latent infection, and measured the impact of stigma on adherence to preventive therapy. Study components included an ethnography of TB stigma, a cross-cultural epidemiologic study, and a community trial of adherence to preventive therapy. Study sites were South Florida, United States, and Leogane, Haiti. The study aimed to investigate: (1) differences in the degree and components of stigma across different sociocultural settings and comparison groups (community members, health care providers, patients); (2) differential stigma effects in a public vs. private, culturally competent clinic; (3) correlates of TB-related stigma; and (4) the influence of perceived stigma on adherence to latent tuberculosis therapy. Data were collected between 2003-2006 in three phases: Phase I Ethnographic Research; Phase II Cultural Epidemiologic Study; and Phase III Adherence Study. A total of 768 persons were interviewed, including 408 women (53 percent) and 360 men (47 percent). All study aims were completed with the exception of No. 2, which was not possible due to the closure of the Haitian Community Clinic in South Florida. The study consists of data from community, patient, and provider interviews. Demographic variables include sex, age, primary language, education level, employment status, marital status, and religion.,Specific Aims: (1) Conduct ethnographic research on the sociocultural context of tuberculosis in Florida and in Haiti, with particular focus on aspects of social stigma related to the disease. (2) Conduct instrument development studies in Florida and in Haiti using the EMIC protocol to produce culturally valid measures of stigma for each setting. (3) Conduct a cultural epidemiologic study of stigma related to tuberculosis in Florida and in Haiti, measuring level of disease-related stigma among three populations in each setting: TB patients, clinic staff, and community residents. There will be two separate populations of patients and clinic staff in Florida (Broward County), one drawn from a public health department clinic, the other from a private Haitian-staffed clinic. Comparison of stigma scores will be made across all groups. (4) Test the hypothesis that perceived stigma is negatively associated with adherence to preventive TB therapy through a quasi-experimental cohort study of latent TB patients in Florida, monitoring both acceptance of preventive therapy as well as adherence to therapy over time. Predictive association between acceptance/duration of treatment and stigma scores will be analyzed.,The Cultural Epidemiologic Study component of the study was adapted based on the EMIC framework for cultural studies of illness developed by Weiss and colleagues (Weiss et al. 1992; Weiss 1997; Weiss 2001; Weiss et al., 2006). The EMIC is a set of protocols for studying cultural components of particular illnesses, including experience, meaning, and behavior. It is operationalized into patterns of distress (PD), perceived causes (PC), and help-seeking (HS). It uses an open-ended query approach to elicit a respondent's perceptions or representations of an illness. Basic questions include \"What is the problem?\", \"What is the cause?\", and \"What kinds of help are appropriate?\". In addition, a special subscale within the EMIC was developed to measure disease-related stigma. The particular set of items used in the Stigma Scale varied depending on the illness condition, cultural context, and population targeted.,Interviewees were selected from three populations: community residents, clinic staff, and clinic patients. Separate open-ended interview guides were developed for each group. The guides included questions related to how Haitians are viewed in South Florida, health problems in the Haitian community, individual and collective behavior related to stigmatized illnesses, explanatory models of tuberculosis, and the impact of tuberculosis on affected individuals. Health care providers were also asked about their experience caring for tuberculosis patients, challenges of providing care to culturally diverse populations, and the difficulties faced by TB patients.,ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection: Performed consistency checks.; Created variable labels and/or value labels.; Standardized missing values.; Created online analysis version with question text.; Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.; Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes..,Datasets: \n \n DS0: Study-Level Files \n DS1: Community Data \n DS2: Patient Data (Restricted Use) \n DS3: Provider Data,face-to-face interview \nSpecial collaborator(s): Gladys Mayard, MA, Haiti Field Director, Centre de Recherches et Services Socio-humanitaire, Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Mitchell Weiss, MD, PhD, Consultant, Swiss Tropical Institute, Basel, Switzerland.,Haitian residents in the United States and residents of Haiti.

This was made up of 293 community (38.15 percent), 316 patient (41.15 percent), and 159 provider respondents (20.7 percent). Community residents were recruited using an organization-based cluster sampling technique (Bernard, 1988; Chavez et al. 1999). Five types of organizations serving the Haitian community were targeted: churches, schools (parents and teachers), businesses, civic/recreational organizations, and social service agencies. Adults between the ages of 18 and 80 were selected through contacts of the research team within the organizations and from information listed in a Haitian Resource booklet provided by Broward County Health Department. For the clinic sample, clinical, outreach and administrative staff from tuberculosis programs and services were interviewed. Patients were selected from hospital (Haiti) or public health department (Florida) TB clinics and included patients with both active disease and latent TB infection (LTBI).,", "doi": "10.3886/icpsr30521.v1", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.3886%2Ficpsr30521.v1", "method": null, "source": "gesis.icpsr", "type_cont": null},

Comparison of stigma scores will be made across all groups. (4) Test the hypothesis that perceived stigma is negatively associated with adherence to preventive TB therapy through a quasi-experimental cohort study of latent TB patients in Florida, monitoring both acceptance of preventive therapy as well as adherence to therapy over time. Predictive association between acceptance/duration of treatment and stigma scores will be analyzed.,The Cultural Epidemiologic Study component of the study was adapted based on the EMIC framework for cultural studies of illness developed by Weiss and colleagues (Weiss et al. 1992; Weiss 1997; Weiss 2001; Weiss et al., 2006). The EMIC is a set of protocols for studying cultural components of particular illnesses, including experience, meaning, and behavior. It is operationalized into patterns of distress (PD), perceived causes (PC), and help-seeking (HS). It uses an open-ended query approach to elicit a respondent's perceptions or representations of an illness. Basic questions include \"What is the problem?\", \"What is the cause?\", and \"What kinds of help are appropriate?\". In addition, a special subscale within the EMIC was developed to measure disease-related stigma. The particular set of items used in the Stigma Scale varied depending on the illness condition, cultural context, and population targeted.,Interviewees were selected from three populations: community residents, clinic staff, and clinic patients. Separate open-ended interview guides were developed for each group. The guides included questions related to how Haitians are viewed in South Florida, health problems in the Haitian community, individual and collective behavior related to stigmatized illnesses, explanatory models of tuberculosis, and the impact of tuberculosis on affected individuals. Health care providers were also asked about their experience caring for tuberculosis patients, challenges of providing care to culturally diverse populations, and the difficulties faced by TB patients.,ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection: Performed consistency checks.; Created variable labels and/or value labels.; Standardized missing values.; Created online analysis version with question text.; Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.; Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes..,Datasets: \n \n DS0: Study-Level Files \n DS1: Community Data \n DS2: Patient Data (Restricted Use) \n DS3: Provider Data,face-to-face interview \nSpecial collaborator(s): Gladys Mayard, MA, Haiti Field Director, Centre de Recherches et Services Socio-humanitaire, Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Mitchell Weiss, MD, PhD, Consultant, Swiss Tropical Institute, Basel, Switzerland.,Haitian residents in the United States and residents of Haiti. Smallest Geographic Unit: county,A total of 768 persons were interviewed, including 408 women (53 percent) and 360 men (47 percent). This was made up of 293 community (38.15 percent), 316 patient (41.15 percent), and 159 provider respondents (20.7 percent). Community residents were recruited using an organization-based cluster sampling technique (Bernard, 1988; Chavez et al. 1999). Five types of organizations serving the Haitian community were targeted: churches, schools (parents and teachers), businesses, civic/recreational organizations, and social service agencies. Adults between the ages of 18 and 80 were selected through contacts of the research team within the organizations and from information listed in a Haitian Resource booklet provided by Broward County Health Department. For the clinic sample, clinical, outreach and administrative staff from tuberculosis programs and services were interviewed. Patients were selected from hospital (Haiti) or public health department (Florida) TB clinics and included patients with both active disease and latent TB infection (LTBI).,", "doi": "10.3886/icpsr30521.v1", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.3886%2Ficpsr30521.v1", "method": null, "source": "gesis.icpsr", "type_cont": null},

Synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) exist in a delicate balance, which is disturbed in a number of diseases. In Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, the balance is skewed towards LTD, which results in cognitive impairments. Long-term synaptic plasticity relies on Calcium signalling in the postsynaptic neuron and the activation of calmodulin and, subsequently, of CaMKII or calcineurin, leading to the induction of LTP or LTD, respectively. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, basal Calcium levels are elevated because of changes in Ca release from intracellular stores, and in transmembrane receptor function. This results in increased activation of calcineurin and hence, increased LTD. We develop a spatial particle-based stochastic model of Ca signalling in the dendritic spine in early LTP and LTD. The model includes Calcium influx through, activation of calmodulin, activation of calmodulin-dependent kinases and phosphatases and their effect on AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor function. This model helps us understand downstream effects of Calcium dysregulation in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We tested the impact of different calcium levels on the molecular pathways of long term plasticity. The healthy version of the model shows how the calcium signalling works in the dendritic spine head. While disease model have impaired calcium pumps, which leads to a build up of calcium within the spine head. The dynamics of the calcium influx can be changed to test the reactivity of pathways in response to calcium signal. This can done by changing the quantity to release and release pattern in MCell.,There are two version of the model, a healthy version and a disease model.

Specifically, spherically expanding flames were studied in the context of heat loss and molecular transport effects. Ignition adjacent to a cold wall was also examined for mixtures that exhibited the negative temperature coefficient behavior, and species stratification due to Ludwig-Soret diffusion. For this purpose, a transient one-dimensional reacting flow code was developed to accurately simulate flame propagation and ignition in the low Mach number regime. \u2767 Computations of flames of heavy molecular weight fuel/air mixtures revealed that the response of such flames to stretch is governed by different mechanisms for fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures. The dynamics of lean mixtures are controlled by the Lewis number which quantifies the non-equidiffusion of heat from and chemical energy into the flame, while for rich mixtures, the response to stretch is governed by the difference in diffusivities between the fuel and oxidizer. It was further demonstrated that, extrapolation equations derived based on numerous simplifying assumptions, when utilized to derive laminar flame speeds from constant pressure spherically expanding flame experimental data, result in substantial uncertainties in the stretch-corrected values. Simulation results also showed that the radiation heat loss from the burned gas ball can lead to non-ideal fluid dynamic effects that imparts uncertainties in the flame speeds derived using flame expansion rate measurements and that additional measurement of the unburned gas velocity is required to circumvent the flow induced uncertainty. \u2767 Consistency between data obtained from counterflow and spherically expanding flame configurations was established by comparing the difference between direct measurements and detailed simulation results for each configuration. The consistency obtained when avoiding the erroneous extrapolation procedure transformed into discrepancy when results post-extrapolation are compared. \u2767 Measurements made during the compression stage of spherically expanding flame propagation in a constant volume vessel is identified as the ideal method to probe flame propagation at conditions of high pressure and temperature. Computations revealed that the flame speeds derived from pressure measurements are highly sensitive to the accuracy of burned gas mass fraction as a function of pressure, which is traditionally determined using thermodynamics-based models. Thus, neglecting radiation energy loss from the burned gas can result in errors in flame speed as large as 15%. Besides, simulation results illustrated that measurements made during the compression stage do not require stretch correction as the compression induced fluid flow results in near stretch-free flames. \u2767 Simulations performed to study the influence of the thermal boundary layer adjacent to a cold wall on the ignition behavior of a combustible gas revealed that exothermic centers could preferentially develop locally in the boundary layer for mixtures that exhibit the negative temperature coefficient behavior and also for mixtures that can stratify as a result of Ludwig-Soret diffusion. This inhomogeneous ignition could result in incorrect interpretation of experimental data from legacy kinetic experiments and could play a role central to the initiation of knock in engines.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c40-232322", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c40-232322", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Here I present an integrated suite of mathematical  tools for understanding evolution on time-invariant fitness landscapes when mutations occur sufficiently rarely that the population is typically monomorphic and evolution can be modeled as a sequence of well-separated fixation events. The basic intuition behind this suite of tools is that surrounding any particular genotype lies a region of the fitness landscape that is easy to evolve to, while other pieces of the fitness landscape are difficult to evolve to (due to distance, being across a fitness valley, etc.). I propose a rigorous definition for this ``dynamical neighborhood' of a genotype which captures several aspects of the distribution of waiting times to evolve from one genotype to another. The neighborhood structure of the landscape as a whole can be summarized as a matrix, and I show how this matrix can be used to approximate the expected waiting time for certain evolutionary events to occur and to provide an intuitive interpretation to existing formal results on the index of dispersion of the molecular clock.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.9b5q2pv", "publicationDate": "2018-08-17", "dateAvailable": "2018-08-17", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9b5q2pv", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

However, as farmers adopt new varieties, in situ population structure and genetic diversity of their seed holdings can change drastically. Consequences of adoption are still poorly understood due to a lack of crop genetic diversity assessments and detailed surveys of farmers\u2019 seed management practices. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is an excellent model for these types of studies, as it has a long history of cultivation among smallholder farmers, exhibits eco-geographic patterns of diversity (e.g., Andean vs. Mesoamerican gene-pools), and has been subjected to post-Columbian dispersal and recent introduction of improved cultivars. The Hoima district of western Uganda additionally provides an excellent social setting for evaluating consequences of adoption because access to improved varieties has varied across farmer groups in this production region. This study establishes a baseline understanding of the common bean diversity found among household producers in Uganda and compares the crop population structure, diversity and consequences of adoption of household producers with different adoption practices. Molecular diversity analysis, based on 4,955 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, evaluated a total of 1,156 seed samples that included 196 household samples collected from household producers in the Hoima district, nineteen breeder-selected varieties used in participatory breeding activities that had taken place prior to the study in the region, and a global bean germplasm collection. Households that had participated in regional participatory breeding efforts were more likely to adopt new varieties and, consequently, diversify their seed stocks than those that had not participated. Of the three farmer groups that participated in breeding efforts, households from the farmer group with the longest history of bean production were more likely to conserve \u201cSeed Engufu\u201d, a local \u201cCalima\u201d-type variety of the Andean bean gene pool, and, at the same time, introduce rare Mesoamerican gene pool varieties into household seed stocks.,Plant Material The collection included a set of 196 household samples collected from producers in Hoima district, nineteen breeder-selected varieties (Table 1) originating from either the CIAT-Kawanda, Uganda, or CIAT-Cali, Colombia, germplasm collections. For comparison, this study included a database of a world-wide reference germplasm collection that consisted of 502 accessions of the Andean Diversity Panel (Cichy et al., 2015), 363 accessions of the USDA core collection (McClean et al., 2012; S. Kuzay, P. Hamilton-Conaty and P. Gepts, unpubl. results), and 57 reference and commercial cultivars. A subset of the breeder-selected samples included in the analysis had been evaluated and made available to breeding program-affiliated households through the CIAT-managed PVS trials from 2012 to 2013. Within the breeder-selected varieties, NABE 11, 15, 17 and 21 were bred locally by the national Ugandan bean program using CIAT-bred lines while the remaining NABE lines were bred under CIAT-led programs. The KAT lines had been bred locally by a Kenyan breeder at the Katumani Research Station in the 1990\u2019s. The 196 household seed stock samples were collected from eight-two households between May and June of 2014, within 2-3 weeks of the first harvest since PVS trials were completed. SNP-Based Genotyping The Illumina Infinium \u201cBeadChip BARCBean6K-3\u201d (Song et al., 2015) from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture BeanCAP Project (Grant number 2009-01929) was used to genotype the entire seed collection. Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was conducted courtesy of Dr. Perry Cregan, USDA-ARS, Soybean Genomics Improvement Laboratory, BARC-West, Beltsville, MD, on the Illumina platform following the Infinium HD Assay Ultra Protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequencing output of the BARCBean6K-3 BeanChip was evaluated using GenomeStudio software. Clusterw2 software was used to align sequences and generate SNP calls. In order to generate reliable SNP calls for household seed samples and breeder-selected samples, cluster files were calibrated from the default set of cluster files. 4,955 of the 5,398 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were then called using the new cluster files with a Gencall score cutoff of 0.15, according to the GenomeStudio Genotyping Module v1.8.4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). SNP data of samples from the global germplasm collection BARCBean6K-3 assay were filtered to include only those having less than 5% missing data and 5% heterozygosity. SNP data of the remaining samples were pruned to 1,870 markers to reduce linkage disequilibrium. Pruning was performed in a moving window of 50 SNPs removing one of a pair of SNPs if the linkage disequilibrium was higher than 0.6. The steps of filtering and pruning were performed in PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007).,", "doi": "10.25338/b8cs3z", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": "2018-04-07", "version": "1", "accessRights": "CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication", "containerURI": "http://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.25338/B8CS3Z", "method": null, "source": "cdl.ucd", "type_cont": null},

Although researcher today have a very clear idea of the molecular activities that define secretory\u2010stage amelogenesis, the molecular events that define enamel maturation remain understudied. \u2767 In chapter two, we set out to investigate the potential role of miRNA regulation in maturation\u2010stage tooth development. We conducted genome\u2010wide miRNA and mRNA transcript expression profiling analyses of secretory\u2010stage and maturation\u2010stage enamel organs obtained from rat incisors. We identified a group of stage\u2010specific miRNAs and identified candidate gene targets based on bioinformatic prediction. Two maturation\u2010stage\u2010related genes, Lamp1 and Tfrc, were verified by luciferase reporter assay to be the target genes of miRNA regulators. The results indicated a dynamic expression pattern of miRNAs during the transition from secretory\u2010stage to maturation\u2010stage enamel mineralization, and suggest that miRNAs can influence key processes of enamel maturation. \u2767 Based on the bioinformatic analyses in chapter two, Slc26 gene family were identified to be involved in the pH regulation process during enamel maturation. Among the 11 members in Slc26 gene family, Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are the only members whose transcripts are significantly up-regulated during maturation\u2010stage enamel formation when compared to secretory\u2010stage. In chapter three, we investigated the function roles of Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 during enamel maturation. We conducted quantitative real\u2010time PCR and Western blot analyses to show that Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are all significantly up\u2010regulated at maturation\u2010stage (relative to secretory\u2010stage) at both miRNA and protein levels. The subsequent immunolocalization assays showed that in the maturation\u2010stage ameloblasts the gene products of Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 localize to the apical region of cytoplasmic membrane, similar to the localization of pattern of Cftr in maturation\u2010stage ameloblasts. In addition, the distribution of Slc26a7 was also seen within the cytoplasmic/subapical region of ameloblast, presumably on the lysosomal membrane. From the protein complex pulled down using an antibody to Cftr; Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 were each separately detected by the subsequent immunoblotting, suggesting the direct interaction of each of these three proteins Slc26 proteins with Cftr. Compared with wild\u2010type (WT) animals, Slc26a1-/- or Slc26a7-/- animals did not show any significant abnormalities in the mature enamel phenotype (density and structure). However, many gene transcripts examined by real\u2010time PCR\u2014such as Car2 (carbonic anhydrase 2), Cftr, Slc4a4/NBCe1, Slc4a9/Ae4, Slc26a9 and Alpl (alkaline phosphatase)\u2014showed significant up\u2010regulation in the enamel organ cells of Slc26a1-/- and Slc26a7-/- animals when compared to age and sex\u2010matched wild\u2010type controls. Collectively, these data indicated that Slc26a1, Slc26a6 and Slc26a7 are actively involved in ion transport related to pH regulation processes during enamel maturation and their functional roles may be achieved, at least in part, by forming complex interactions with Cftr.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-572083", "publicationDate": "2016-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-572083", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The aim of this study was to carry out a preliminary epidemiological investigation of tuberculosis (TB) cases in Rome. Methods: A total of 232 Mtb isolates, collected from new or previously treated patients, admitted between 2008 and 2014 at 2 hospital settings in Rome with a diagnosis of TB, were analyzed by spoligotyping and analyzing 24 variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit (MIRU) loci. The SITVIT2 database and the MIRU-VNTRplus web applications were used to identify the strain genotypes and to generate phylogenetic trees. Results: Based on the position on the phylogenetic tree, 97.4% of the strains were associated with 1 of the 7 main lineages. The Euro-American lineage was the most commonly represented (81.9%) within both Italian and foreign-born populations, although all main lineages were present. The highest frequency of drug-resistant strains was found among the East-Asian lineage (Beijing genotype) isolated from foreign-born patients. Conclusions: Dynamics of TB transmission in Rome indicate recent spread of Mtb strains belonging to phylogeographic lineages and clades usually found in countries and geographic areas with a high incidence of TB, similarly to what is observed in most metropolitan areas in Western Europe. Knowledge from molecular and classical epidemiology provides an important tool for disease control.", "doi": "10.6084/m9.figshare.6530948", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": "CC BY 4.0", "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.6530948", "method": null, "source": "figshare.ars", "type_cont": null},

The pathophysiological course of metastasis is mediated by the dynamic plasticity of cancer cells, which enables them to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes through a transcriptionally regulated program termed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic breast cancer, we investigated the molecular mediators of metastatic competence within a heterogeneous primary tumor and how these cells then manipulated their epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during the metastatic process. We isolated cells from the primary mammary tumor, the circulation, and metastatic lesions in the lung in TA2 mice and found that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 mediated EMT and MET by differentially acting as a sponge for the microRNAs miR-200b/c and let-7b. We found that this ability enabled H19 to modulate the expression of the microRNA targets Git2 and Cyth3, respectively, which encode regulators of the RAS superfamily member adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor (ARF), a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that promotes cell migration associated with EMT and disseminating tumor cells. Decreasing the abundance of H19 or manipulating that of members in its axis prevented metastasis from grafts in syngeneic mice. Abundance of H19, GIT2, and CYTH3 in patient samples further suggests that H19 might be exploited as a biomarker for metastatic cells within breast tumors and perhaps as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.t5pv8", "publicationDate": "2017-08-21", "dateAvailable": "2017-08-21", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t5pv8", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Population genetic variability and the genetic structure of C. includens populations were evaluated by using ISSR markers with samples from the major soybean producing regions in Brazil in the growing seasons 2011/2012. Seven different primers were applied for population characterization of the molecular variability and genetic structure of 8 soybean looper populations from 8 states of Brazil. The seven ISSR loci generated 247 bands in 246 individuals of C. includens sampled. The expected heterozygosity (HE) in the populations varied between 0.093 and 0.106, while the overall HE was 0.099, indicating low genetic diversity. The analysis of molecular variance indicated that 98% of the variability was expressed among individuals within populations (FST = 0.021, p = 0.001). The low level of polymorphism over all populations, the high levels of gene flow, and the low genetic structure are indicatives of the exchange of genetic information between the different sampled regions. Population structuring suggests the presence of two major groups which do not correlate with their geographic sampling location in Brazil. These results may indicate recent recolonization of C. includens in Brazil or migration patterns following source-sink dynamics. Furthermore, the presence of two groups within C. includens suggests that a study on development of resistance or any other genetic-based trait needs to be evaluated on both groups, and pest management in soybean fields should be aware that differences may come to the control strategies they use.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.s64jp", "publicationDate": "2015-04-14", "dateAvailable": "2015-04-14", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s64jp", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The aim of this study was to carry out a preliminary epidemiological investigation of tuberculosis (TB) cases in Rome. Methods: A total of 232 Mtb isolates, collected from new or previously treated patients, admitted between 2008 and 2014 at 2 hospital settings in Rome with a diagnosis of TB, were analyzed by spoligotyping and analyzing 24 variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit (MIRU) loci. The SITVIT2 database and the MIRU-VNTRplus web applications were used to identify the strain genotypes and to generate phylogenetic trees. Results: Based on the position on the phylogenetic tree, 97.4% of the strains were associated with 1 of the 7 main lineages. The Euro-American lineage was the most commonly represented (81.9%) within both Italian and foreign-born populations, although all main lineages were present. The highest frequency of drug-resistant strains was found among the East-Asian lineage (Beijing genotype) isolated from foreign-born patients. Conclusions: Dynamics of TB transmission in Rome indicate recent spread of Mtb strains belonging to phylogeographic lineages and clades usually found in countries and geographic areas with a high incidence of TB, similarly to what is observed in most metropolitan areas in Western Europe.

Doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) is a unique mode of mitochondrial transmission found in bivalve species, in which two distinct mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) lines are present, one inherited through eggs (F) and one through sperm (M). During development, the two lines segregate in a sex- and tissue-specific manner: females lose M during embryogenesis, whereas males actively segregate it in the germ line. These two pivotal events are still poorly characterized. Here we investigated mtDNA replication dynamics during embryogenesis and pre-adulthood of the venerid Ruditapes philippinarum using real-time quantitative PCR. We found that both mtDNAs do not detectably replicate during early embryogenesis, and that the M line might be lost from females around 24\u2009h of age. A rise in mtDNA copy number was observed before the first reproductive season in both sexes, with the M mitochondrial genome replicating more than the F in males, and we associate these boosts to the early phase of gonad production. As evidence indicates that DUI relies on the same molecular machine of mitochondrial maternal inheritance that is common in most animals, our data are relevant not only to DUI but also to shed light on how differential segregations of mtDNA variants, in the same nuclear background, may be controlled during development.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.q3hs1", "publicationDate": "2015-10-19", "dateAvailable": "2015-10-19", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q3hs1", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health", "doi": "10.17632/5thy2mcwn7.6", "publicationDate": "2018-10-24", "dateAvailable": "2018-10-24", "version": "6", "accessRights": "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5thy2mcwn7", "method": "", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Of the five agricultural systems practised by fungus\u2010growing ants, higher\u2010attine agriculture, of which leaf\u2010cutter agriculture is a derived subset, remains poorly understood despite its relevance to ecosystem function and human agriculture across the Neotropics and parts of North America. Among the ants practising higher\u2010attine agriculture, the genus Trachymyrmex Forel, as currently defined, shares most\u2010recent common ancestors with both the leaf\u2010cutter ants and the higher\u2010attine genera Sericomyrmex Mayr and Xerolitor Sosa\u2010Calvo et al. Although previous molecular\u2010phylogenetic studies have suggested that Trachymyrmex is a paraphyletic grade, until now insufficient taxon sampling has prevented a full investigation of the evolutionary history of this group and limited the possibility of resolving its taxonomy. Here we describe the results of phylogenetic analyses of 38 Trachymyrmex species, including 27 of the 49 described species and at least 11 new species, using four nuclear markers, as well as phylogenetic analyses of the fungi cultivated by 23 species of Trachymyrmex using two markers. We generated new genetic data for 112 ants (402 new gene sequences) and 95 fungi (153 new gene sequences). Our results corroborate previous findings that Trachymyrmex, as currently defined, is paraphyletic. We propose recognizing two new genera, Mycetomoellerius gen.n. and Paratrachymyrmex gen.n., and restricting the continued use of Trachymyrmex to the clade of nine largely North American species that contains the type species [Trachymyrmex septentrionalis (McCook)] and that is the sister group of the leaf\u2010cutting ants. Our fungal cultivar phylogeny generally corroborates previously observed broad patterns of ant\u2013fungus association, but it also reveals further violations of those patterns. Higher\u2010attine fungi are divided into two groups: (i) the single species Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (M\u00f6ller); and (ii) its sister clade, consisting of multiple species, recently referred to as Leucoagaricus Singer \u2018clade B\u2019. Our phylogeny indicates that, although most non\u2010leaf\u2010cutting higher\u2010attine ants typically cultivate species in clade B, some species cultivate L. gongylophorus, whereas still others cultivate fungi typically associated with lower\u2010attine agriculture. This indicates that the attine agricultural systems, which are currently defined by associations between ants and fungi, are not entirely congruent with ant and fungal phylogenies. They may, however, be correlated with as yet poorly understood biological traits of the ants and/or of their microbiomes.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.2p7r771", "publicationDate": "2019-09-09", "dateAvailable": "2019-09-09", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2p7r771", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

The mammalian brain is a remarkable organ that continues to fascinate biologists with its ability to undergo experience-dependent adaptations, and this property is preserved throughout the life. Brain plasticity on the molecular and cellular level within neurons is thought to occur in response to neuronal activity, continuously changing the strength of synapses and thus influencing the connections between neurons. Synapses are weakened or strengthened in response to specific patterns of neuronal activity. The underlying mechanism of synaptic plasticity is thought to consist of the regulated release of neurotransmitters (chemical mediators of neuronal communication) from the presynaptic side, and changes in the expression levels and availability of corresponding receptors located predominantly on the postsynaptic side of the synapse.  Numerous studies over the past three decades have focused on elucidating the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity, with the goal of better understanding the link between transient changes in neuronal activity in response to experience, and short- and long-term changes in brain circuitry that underlie learning, memory and adaptive behavior. However, many key questions remain unresolved.  The results of research efforts presented in this dissertation represent a modest contribution to our increasing knowledge of experience-dependent brain plasticity and its relevance to human health.; Naturally, the most dramatic changes in the complexity and functionality of any brain region happen during development, when a single sheet of precursor cells gives rise to a complex organ with multiple types of neurons, communicating through billions of connections and using different types of chemical messengers, the neurotransmitters. At the other end of life, during aging and the neurodegenerative processes, the brain undergoes a different kind of plasticity, a dynamic process that effectively breaks connections between neurons, and severely impairs numerous brain functions. Looking from the outside, these two periods of life seem to initiate the most dramatic and highly dynamic of all the changes in the brain as they are evident through striking changes in behavior or by the gain or the loss of functions. However, throughout the healthy adult life, more subtle, yet important plastic changes happen in the brain at both the molecular and cellular level, enabling animals and humans to learn new motor skills or a new language and remember places and people they meet. Emerging new research suggests that dynamics in the brain go beyond learning processes. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that daily experiences, stress, physical activity, diet, and lifestyle changes are all factors that cause subtle plastic changes in the brain, bringing both positive and negative consequences to overall brain function. In this dissertation, I investigated adult brain plasticity in health and disease. For my research I used the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson\u2019s disease. This animal model enabled me to investigate plastic changes in the brain on the molecular and cellular level and also provided me with a simple model of behavioral changes. The first study of this dissertation was designed to investigate the plasticity in the serotonin system in different brain regions following a neurotoxic brain injury resulting in severe loss of dopamine (presented in Chapter 2).; Serotonin is a chemical used by different brain regions for communication between neurons. Through its signaling in the frontal cortex, amygdala and midbrain, serotonin controls complex behaviors such as fear response and memory formation, and its imbalance is closely linked to human psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. In the study presented in Chapter 2, severe dopamine depletion caused loss of serotonin in multiple brain regions in the mice treated with MPTP, and this neurotransmitter imbalance caused memory impairments, but not depression and anxiety-like behaviors. Three other studies in this dissertation focused on investigating experience-driven neuroplasticity in the adult mouse brain. Specifically, in Chapter 3, my studies focused on plastic changes in expression of dopamine receptor D2 in the striatum of mice lesioned with MPTP and exposed to daily treadmill exercise. Dopamine receptors are gates of dopamine signaling in the brain and without them the neurotransmitter cannot be used for communication between neurons. Results presented in Chapter 3 indicate that daily treadmill exercise for 6 weeks increases expression of dopamine receptor D2 in the striatum of mice. This finding was also confirmed using in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of live mice. Using the same experimental model in Chapter 4, I examined the plastic changes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the principal neurons in the striatum, focusing on the analysis of their complex morphology. The analysis showed that 6 weeks of treadmill exercise increased the spine density on MSNs in the dorsolateral striatum, and this increase was observed in both control and MPTP-lesioned mice but was more pronounced in the lesioned mice. This finding was supported by electron microscopy analysis of synapse number, which showed significant increase in response to treadmill exercise.; I investigated this phenomenon further in Chapter 5 by focusing on a subset of MSNs, those that are part of the striatal indirect pathway and predominantly express dopamine D2 receptors. This study used a transgenic mouse model that was engineered to allow direct visualization of the indirect pathway MSNs in the mouse brain using the fluorescent microscope. Results of this study showed that spine density changes on MSNs in response to exercise occur in indirect pathway neurons and future analysis will investigate if these changes are restricted to this striatal pathway or if they also occur in direct pathway MSNs. Analysis of glutamate AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) receptor composition in indirect pathway MSNs showed that treadmill exercise increased expression levels of the GluR2 subunit of this receptor in both control and MPTP lesioned mice. Electrophysiological recordings support these findings. Subunit composition of glutamate AMPA receptors is critical for experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in multiple brain regions, including the striatum. Modulation of AMPA receptor subunit composition through treadmill exercise training could be a part of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the benefits of exercise on the brain in both healthy individuals and people affected with PD.; Taken together, the results of the studies presented in this dissertation contribute to our knowledge and understanding of adult brain plasticity in health and disease. In addition, studies in this dissertation contribute to our better understanding of animal models of human diseases.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m3541", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3541", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The effects of initial mole ratio of DPC/BPA and with or without catalyst on molecular weight of the obtained PC were investigated by gel permeation chromatography. It was found that at initial mole ratio of DPC/BPA at 1.26/1.00 without an addition of catalyst was an appropriate for the preparation of branched PC in a controlled manner. The influence of types and amount of branching agents on PC molecular weight profile were also studied. 1,1,1-tris(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (THPE), 3,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)oxindole and 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane were prove to be candidates as branching agents for branched PC synthesis. The condensation reaction of DPC/BPA with 3 mol% of THPE at temperature up to 250 oC and pressure of 100 mmHg provided molecular weight of branched PC product about of 26,294. 3 mol% of THPE was found to be the most appropriate and promising choice of branched PC synthesis as can be confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The melt viscosity of branched PC with 3 mol% of THPE exhibited a high shear sensitivity to that of commercialized branched PC with relatively low melt flow index suggesting a presence of long chain branching in our branched PC. The thermal and thermomechanical properties of branched PC product were also studied using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analysis. The thermal properties of synthesized branched PC i.e. glass transition and degradation temperature were close to that of the commercial branched PC.

Gene mutations of enamel proteases were found to cause amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a hereditary disease affecting dental enamel. Two types of enamel proteases have been previously identified and reported to cleave amelogenin. However, the molecular mechanisms and function of enamel proteases during amelogenesis still remains unclear. I designed a series of in vitro experiments to systematically study the function of enamel proteases on amelogenin processing, assembly and interactions between amelogenin and apatite following proteolytic activities.; Methods and materials: Three amelogenin proteins were used: recombinant full length pig amelogenin (rP172), recombinant homolog of its major cleavage product (rP148), and a native amelogenin lacking both N- and C-termini (13k). Recombinant pig MMP20 (rpMMP20) and recombinant human kallikrein 4 (rhKLK4) were incubated with each of these three amelogenins with and without HAP crystals. Proteolytic products were detected by SDS-PAGE, HPLC, and mass spectrometry. Assembly properties of these three amelogenins and their proteolytic products were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Affinity of thethree amelogenins to apatite was systematically evaluated by means of Langmuir model for protein adsorption.; Results: rpMMP20 cleaved rP172 more efficiently than it cleaved rP148 and it didn't process the \"13k\". rhKLK4 processed all of the above with an exponential reduction. These three amelogenins had different assembly properties. The cleavage of Cterminus led to aggregation of amelogenin; and the N-terminal cleavage resulted in the dis-assembly of amelogenin molecules. During proteolysis amelogenin substrates had higher binding affinity to HAP than their proteolytic products. HAP did not change the cleavage pattern of amelogenin by proteases. Comparative adsorption isotherms indicated the binding affinity of amelogenins in the order, rP172&gt;rP148&gt;13k. Conclusions: Processing of amelogenin by MMP20 and KLK-4 is stepwise, progressive, and with different patterns. Enamel proteinases cause alterations of amelogenin assembly with consequence of dis-assembly. Cleavages of C- and N-termini of amelogenin reduce its apatite binding affinity. We suggest that such controlled proteolysis will dictate the function of amelogenin in controlling crystal morphology and orientation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-m1063", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m1063", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

The dynamic assembly and disassembly of the different autophagic protein complexes at the so-called phagophore assembly site (PAS) is strictly regulated. Rab GTPases are major regulators of cellular vesicle trafficking, and the Rab GTPase Ypt1 and its GEF TRAPPIII have been implicated in autophagy. We show that Gyp1 acts as a Ypt1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for selective autophagic variants, such as the Cvt pathway or the selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy). Gyp1 regulates the dynamic disassembly of the conserved Ypt1-Atg1 complex. Thereby, Gyp1 sets the stage for efficient Atg14 recruitment, and facilitates the critical step from nucleation to elongation of the phagophore. In addition, we identified Gyp1 as a new Atg8-interacting motif (AIM)-dependent Atg8 interaction partner. The Gyp1 AIM is required for efficient formation of the cargo receptor-Atg8 complexes. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of complex disassembly during phagophore formation and suggest potential dual functions of GAPs in cellular vesicle trafficking.

However estimating Ne, and identifying key demographic mechanisms that underlie the Ne to census population size (N) ratio, remains challenging, especially for small populations with overlapping generations and substantial environmental and demographic stochasticity and hence dynamic age-structure.\n\n2.A sophisticated demographic method of estimating Ne/N, which uses Fisher's reproductive value to account for dynamic age-structure, has been formulated. However this method requires detailed individual- and population-level data on sex- and age-specific reproduction and survival, and has rarely been implemented.\n\n3.Here we use the reproductive value method and detailed demographic data to estimate Ne/N for a small and apparently isolated red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population of high conservation concern. We additionally calculated two single-sample molecular genetic estimates of Ne to corroborate the demographic estimate and examine evidence for unobserved immigration and gene flow.\n\n4.The demographic estimate of Ne/N was 0.21, reflecting a high total demographic variance (\u03c32dg) of 0.71. Females and males made similar overall contributions to \u03c32dg. However, contributions varied among sex-age classes, with greater contributions from 3 year-old females than males, but greater contributions from \u22655 year-old males than females.\n\n5.The demographic estimate of Ne was ~30, suggesting that rates of increase of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation per generation will be relatively high. Molecular genetic estimates of Ne computed from linkage disequilibrium and approximate Bayesian computation were approximately 50 and 30 respectively, providing no evidence of substantial unobserved immigration which could bias demographic estimates of Ne.\n\n6. Our analyses identify key sex-age classes contributing to demographic variance and thus decreasing Ne/N in a small age-structured population inhabiting a variable environment. They thereby demonstrate how assessments of Ne can incorporate stochastic sex- and age-specific demography and elucidate key demographic processes affecting a population's evolutionary trajectory and viability. Furthermore, our analyses show that Ne for the focal chough population is critically small, implying that management to re-establish genetic connectivity may be required to ensure population viability.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.68kk0", "publicationDate": "2017-05-31", "dateAvailable": "2017-05-31", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.68kk0", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Indeed, many taxa have parapatric distributions at present. It is often unclear if these are secondary contacts, e.g. caused by past glaciation cycles or the manifestation of speciation with gene flow, which hampers our understanding of how different forces drive diversification. Here we studied genetic, phenotypic and ecological aspects of divergence in a pair of incipient shorebird species, the Kentish (Charadrius alexandrinus) and the white-faced Plovers (C. dealbatus), shorebirds with parapatric breeding ranges along the Chinese coast. We assessed divergence based on molecular markers with different modes of inheritance and quantified phenotypic and ecological divergence in aspects of morphometric, dietary and climatic niches.\n\nResults: Our integrative analyses revealed small to moderate levels of genetic and phenotypic distinctiveness with symmetric gene flow across the contact area at the Chinese coast. The two species diverged approximately half a million years ago in dynamic isolation with secondary contact occurring due to cycling sea level changes between the Eastern and Southern China Sea in the mid-late Pleistocene. We found evidence of character displacement and ecological niche differentiation between the two species, invoking the role of selection in facilitating divergence despite gene flow.\n\nConclusion: These findings imply that ecology can indeed counter gene flow through divergent selection and thus contributes to incipient speciation in these plovers. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of using integrative datasets to reveal the evolutionary history and assist the inference of mechanisms of speciation.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.3r01b8d", "publicationDate": "2019-05-31", "dateAvailable": "2019-05-31", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3r01b8d", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Although this research program has been somewhat successful, most statistical methods employed were designed to detect consistent, weak to moderate selection. In contrast, phenotypic studies in nature show that selection varies in time and that individual bouts of selection can be strong. Measurements of the genomic consequences of such fluctuating selection could help test and refine hypotheses concerning the causes of ecological specialization and the maintenance of genetic variation in populations. Herein, I proposed a Bayesian non-homogenous hidden Markov model to estimate effective population sizes and quantify variable selection in heterogeneous environments from genetic time-series data. The model is described and then evaluated using a series of simulated data, including cases where selection occurs on a trait with a simple or polygenic molecular basis. The proposed method accurately distinguished neutral loci from non-neutral loci under strong selection, but not from those under weak selection. Selection coefficients were accurately estimated when selection was constant or when the fitness values of genotypes varied linearly with the environment, but these estimates were less accurate when fitness was polygenic or the relationship between the environment and the fitness of genotypes was non-linear. Past studies of temporal evolutionary dynamics in lab populations have been remarkably successful. The proposed method makes similar analyses of genetic time-series data from natural populations more feasible, and thereby could help answer fun damental questions about the causes and consequences of evolution in the wild.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.14853", "publicationDate": "2015-07-16", "dateAvailable": "2015-07-16", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.14853", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Tubulins are dynamic proteins which assemble into polymers called microtubules to participate in critical roles throughout the cell such as cytoskeletal stability, intracellular transport, and mitosis. Given their physiological importance, these native protein polymers have been clinically exploited as targets for small molecule drugs capable of interfering with the microtubule network. Elastin\u2010like polypeptides (ELPs), meanwhile, constitute a genetically engineered class of \u2018protein polymers\u2019 derived from human tropoelastin. They exhibit a reversible phase separation whereby samples remain soluble below a transition temperature (T\u209c) but form amorphous coacervates above T\u209c. ELPs phase behavior has many possible applications in purification and nanoassembly which can be further expanded by fusing this thermoresponsive moiety to native proteins. Recombinant synthesis additionally affords precise control over an ELP fusion protein\u2019s architecture and molecular weight, resulting in functionalized protein polymers with uniform physicochemical properties suited to the design of tools relevant to nanomedicine and synthetic biology. The studies featured within this dissertation therefore explore tubulin\u2010ELP fusion proteins as multifunctional tools with three broad applications\u2014namely, as colchicine nanocarriers, tubulin\u2010based purification tools, and intracellular switches. Although unsuccessful as colchicine nanocarriers, these ELP\u2010based tools have potentiated a non\u2010chromatographic method for the purification of recombinantly expressed tubulins and offer the possibility of thermally regulating microtubule dynamics within an intracellular milieu.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c89-139861", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c89-139861", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Gyp1 regulates the dynamic disassembly of the conserved Ypt1-Atg1 complex. Thereby, Gyp1 sets the stage for efficient Atg14 recruitment, and facilitates the critical step from nucleation to elongation of the phagophore. In addition, we identified Gyp1 as a new Atg8-interacting motif (AIM)-dependent Atg8 interaction partner. The Gyp1 AIM is required for efficient formation of the cargo receptor-Atg8 complexes. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of complex disassembly during phagophore formation and suggest potential dual functions of GAPs in cellular vesicle trafficking.

Although this research program has been somewhat successful, most statistical methods employed were designed to detect consistent, weak to moderate selection. In contrast, phenotypic studies in nature show that selection varies in time and that individual bouts of selection can be strong. Measurements of the genomic consequences of such fluctuating selection could help test and refine hypotheses concerning the causes of ecological specialization and the maintenance of genetic variation in populations. Herein, I proposed a Bayesian non-homogenous hidden Markov model to estimate effective population sizes and quantify variable selection in heterogeneous environments from genetic time-series data. The model is described and then evaluated using a series of simulated data, including cases where selection occurs on a trait with a simple or polygenic molecular basis. The proposed method accurately distinguished neutral loci from non-neutral loci under strong selection, but not from those under weak selection. Selection coefficients were accurately estimated when selection was constant or when the fitness values of genotypes varied linearly with the environment, but these estimates were less accurate when fitness was polygenic or the relationship between the environment and the fitness of genotypes was non-linear. Past studies of temporal evolutionary dynamics in lab populations have been remarkably successful. The proposed method makes similar analyses of genetic time-series data from natural populations more feasible, and thereby could help answer fun damental questions about the causes and consequences of evolution in the wild.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.14853", "publicationDate": "2015-07-16", "dateAvailable": "2015-07-16", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.14853", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  \n      \n      \n          Purpose:  \n      \n      \n          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    \n      \n      \n          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  \n      \n      \n          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.\n      \n      \n          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  \n      \n      \n          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  \n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  \n      \n      \n          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).

Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  \n      \n      \n          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  \n      \n      \n          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).

These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  \n      \n      \n          Purpose:  \n      \n      \n          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    \n      \n      \n          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  \n      \n      \n          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.\n      \n      \n          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  \n      \n      \n          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  \n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  \n      \n      \n          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).\n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. \n      \n      \n          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  \n      \n      \n          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  \n      \n      \n          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.  \n      \n      \n          Column Names:  \t\t\tDescription\n      \n          Site:  \t\t\t\tHouse designation or name of Baltimore Ecosystem Study forested reference plot\n      \n          REP#:  \t\t\t\tUsed to distinguish between multiple measurements at a single Site\n      \n          Depth:  \t\t\tDepth interval from which the soil was collected.

These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  \n      \n      \n          Purpose:  \n      \n      \n          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    \n      \n      \n          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  \n      \n      \n          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.\n      \n      \n          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  \n      \n      \n          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  \n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  \n      \n      \n          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).\n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. \n      \n      \n          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  \n      \n      \n          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  \n      \n      \n          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.  \n      \n      \n          Column Names:  \t\t\tDescription\n      \n      \n          1.

These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  \n      \n      \n          Purpose:  \n      \n      \n          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (76o 30\ufffd , 39o 15\ufffd and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    \n      \n      \n          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  \n      \n      \n          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.\n      \n      \n          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  \n      \n      \n          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  \n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  \n      \n      \n          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).\n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. \n      \n      \n          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  \n      \n      \n          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  \n      \n      \n          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.  \n      \n      \n          Column Names:  \t\t\tDescription\n      \n          Site:  \t\t\t\tHouse designation or name of Baltimore Ecosystem Study forested reference plot\n      \n          REP#:  \t\t\t\tUsed to distinguish between multiple measurements at a single Site\n      \n          Depth:  \t\t\tDepth interval from which the soil was collected.

Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  \n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).  Bulk density (BD) was calculated as BD = (Total Dry Mass - Rock Mass) / (Total Volume - Rock Volume).  \n      \n      \n          Soil texture was obtained by the hydrometer method (Gee and J.W. 1986).  Total C and N were obtained by flash-combustion / oxidation using a Thermo Finnigan Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (0.06% C and 0.01% N detection limits).  For all data, the density of C in a unit area (1 m2) was calculated as C = CfBD(1-d2mm)V, where C is carbon density, d2mm is the fraction of material larger than 2 mm diameter, BD is bulk density, Cf is the fraction by mass of organic C, and V is the volume of the soil core (Post et al., 1982).\n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were set aside to determine 1) initial KCl exchangeable NO3- and NH4+, 2) net nitrification, net mineralization and basal respiration, and 3) microbial biomass C and N. \n      \n      \n          Exchangeable inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+) was extracted from approximately 10 g (dry mass) of soil with 40 ml of 2 M KCl.  Samples were agitated for 60 min at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker table and then left undisturbed for 2 hours.  The supernatant liquid from each sample was then collected and filtered through Whatman number 42 filter paper into nalgene bottles.  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically for NO3- and NH4+ concentration using a Lachat Flow Injection Analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO 80539).  \n      \n      \n          Rates of potential net N mineralization, nitrification, and respiration were measured in a 10-day laboratory incubation of soils at room temperature. Soils (25 grams per incubation) were placed in 946-mL glass jars with lids fitted with septa for gas sampling. After 10 days, the headspace of the jars was sampled by syringe, and the gas samples were analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO2) by thermal conductivity gas chromatography.  Inorganic N was extracted as described above. Mineralization was calculated as the accumulation of total inorganic N, nitrification was calculated as the accumulation of NO3-, and respiration was calculated as the accumulation of CO2 over the course of the 10-day incubation.  \n      \n      \n          Microbial biomass C and N were measured using the chloroform fumigation-incubation method (Jenkinson and Powlson 1976).  Field moist soils (25 grams) were fumigated to lyse microbial cells in the samples. The fumigated samples were then inoculated with fresh soil, allowing microorganisms to regrow using the dead cells as substrate. The flushes of CO2 and 2 M KCl-extractable inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-) released by the cells during the incubation were assumed to be proportional to the C and N in the microbial biomass of the original sample. A proportionality constant (0.45) was used to calculate biomass C from the CO2 ?ush, which was measured by thermal conductivity gas chromatography. Inorganic N flush data were not corrected with a proportionality constant.  \n      \n      \n          Column Names:  \t\t\tDescription\n      \n      \n          1.

These were compared to soils from 8 forested reference sites.  \n      \n      \n          Purpose:  \n      \n      \n          Soil cores were obtained from residential and forest sites in the Baltimore, MD USA metropolitan area.  The residential sites were mostly within the Gwynns Falls Watershed (-76.012008W, -77.314183E, 39.724847N, 38.708367S and approximately 17 km2) Lawns on residential sites were dominated by a variety of cool season turfgrasses.  Forest soil cores were taken from permanent forest plots of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER (Groffman et al. 2006).  These remnant forests are over 100 years old with soils that were comparable in type and texture to those underlying the residential study sites.  Soils from all sites were from the Manor series (coarse-loamy, micaceous, mesic Typic Dystrudepts), which are well-drained upland soils with loamy textures and bedrock at 5 to 10 feet below the soil surface.    \n      \n      \n          To aid the site selection process we used neighborhoods in the Baltimore City metropolitan area that have been mapped using HERCULES, a high resolution land cover classification system designed to assist in the study of human-ecological systems (Cadenasso et al. 2007).  Using HERCULES and additional data sources, we identified residential sites that were similar except for single factors that we hypothesized to be important predictors of ecosystem dynamics.  These factors included land use history (agriculture and forest, n = 10 and n = 22), housing density (low and medium/high, n = 9 and n = 23), and housing age (4 to 58 yrs old, n = 32).  Housing age was acquired from the Maryland Property View database.  Prior land use was determined based on land use change maps developed by integrating aerial photos from 1938, 1957, 1971, and 1999 into a geographic information system.  Once a list of residential parcels meeting the predefined criteria were identified, we sent mailings to property owners chosen at random from each of the factor groups with the goal of recruiting 40 property owners for a 3 year study (of which this work is a part).  We had recruited 32 property owners at the time that soil cores were obtained.  \n      \n      \n          Soil coring took place over a one month period during the summer of 2007.  For residential sites, we overlaid a grid onto a map of each property and randomly chose two locations for coring.  Locations beneath impervious surfaces (buildings, walkways, driveways) or within close proximity to belowground pipes and power lines were excluded and another random location identified.  Undisturbed one-meter soil cores were extracted from each of these locations using a 3.3 cm diameter soil corer.  Cores were enclosed in plastic sleeves with end-caps, put into coolers, and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 oC until they could be processed.  Coring in the forested reference plots followed a similar procedure, with two cores taken from random locations at each site.  In total, 80 intact soil cores were collected from 32 residential properties and 8 forest sites.\n      \n      \n          Digital photos were taken of each soil core followed by a visual inspection to determine horizon depths and Munsell color.  Soil cores were also inspected for obvious signs of disturbance such as buried horizons, lithologic discontinuities, or human artifacts of less than 3.3 cm (the diameter of the soil core).  \n      \n      \n          Cores were divided into four soil depth intervals (0 to 10 cm, 10 to 30 cm, 30 to 70 cm, and 70 to 100cm) and sorted to remove coarse roots and rocks (&gt; 2 mm). The roots and rocks were dried at 105 oC, weighed and set aside.  Rock volume was determined by mass and an assumed density of 2.7 g/cm3.  \n      \n      \n          Subsamples of homogenized soil from each depth interval were analyzed for soil dry weight and percent moisture (48 hrs at 105 oC).

Regularly repeated changes in the environment, such as diel lighting, can result in two different organismal responses: a direct response to the presence and absence of exogenous light and endogenous rhythms resulting from a molecular circadian clock, both of which can influence the associated microbiota. Here, we report how diel lighting and a potential circadian clock impacts the diversity and relative abundance of bacteria in the model cnidarian Nematostella vectensis using an amplicon-based sequencing approach. Comparisons of bacterial communities associated with anemones cultured in constant darkness and in light:dark conditions revealed that individuals entrained in the dark had a more diverse microbiota. Overall community composition showed little variation over a 24-hour period in either treatment; however, abundances of individual bacterial OTUs showed significant cycling in each treatment. A comparative analysis of genes involved in the innate immune system of cnidarians showed differential expression between lighting conditions in N. vectensis, with significant up-regulation during long-term darkness for a subset of genes. Together, our studies support a hypothesis that the bacterial community associated with this species is relatively stable under diel light conditions when compared with static conditions and that particular bacterial members may have time-dependent abundance that coincides with the diel photoperiod in an otherwise stable community.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.hf33q77", "publicationDate": "2019-08-26", "dateAvailable": "2019-08-26", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hf33q77", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active matter systems may be optimized to produce highly dissipative dynamical states, hence, leading to spontaneous emergence of more ordered states. This interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent one of the most salient examples of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of dissipa- tion optimization. In order to start addressing this question using detailed computational modeling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform, which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical re- actions and relaxation of mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. This is done by computing precise changes in Gibbs free energy accompanying chemical reactions using a novel formula, and through detailed calculations of instantaneous values of the system\u2019s mechanical energy. We validate our approach with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self- organization of small disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we do not observe that spontaneous network reorganizations lead to increases in the total dissipation rate as predicted by the dissipation- driven adaptation hypothesis mentioned above. However, whether such a principle operates in more general, more complex cytoskeletal networks remains to be investigated.,", "doi": "10.13016/t8oa-9qra", "publicationDate": "2019-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.13016%2Ft8oa-9qra", "method": null, "source": "umd.lib", "type_cont": null},

To learn how viruses respond to this pressure, we disrupted the genetic network of Escherichia coli to inhibit replication of its virus, bacteriophage lambda, and then observed how \u03bb evolved to compensate. We deleted E. coli's dnaJ gene, which lambda uses to initiate DNA replication. Lambda partially restored its ability to reproduce with just two adaptive mutations associated with genes J and S. The location of the mutations was unexpected because they were not in genes that directly interact with DnaJ, rather they affected seemingly unrelated life history traits. A nonsynonymous J mutation increased \u03bb\u2019s adsorption rate and an S regulatory mutation delayed lysis timing. \u03bb also recovered some of its reproductive potential through intracellular mutualism. This study offers two important lessons: first, viruses can rapidly adapt to disruptive changes in their host's genetic network. Second, organisms can employ mechanisms thought to operate at the population scale, such as evolution of life history traits and social interactions, in order to overcome hurdles at the molecular level.

There were several motivations for this study. First, bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) is the most commonly used pro-inflammatory stimulus for microglia, both in vitro and in vivo; however, pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) rather than LPS will be encountered with sterile CNS damage and disease. We lack direct comparisons of responses between LPS and such cytokines. Second, while transcriptional profiling is providing substantial data on microglial responses to LPS, these studies mainly use mouse cells and models, and there is increasing evidence that responses of rat microglia can differ. Third, the cytokine milieu is dynamic after acute CNS damage, and an important question in microglial biology is: How malleable are their responses? There are very few studies of effects of resolving cytokines, particularly for rat microglia, and much of the work has focused on pro-inflammatory outcomes. Here, we first exposed primary rat microglia to LPS or to IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1 (I+T) and compared hallmark functional (nitric oxide production, migration) and molecular responses (almost 100 genes), including surface receptors that can be considered part of the sensome. Protein changes for exemplary molecules were also quantified: ARG1, CD206/MRC1, COX-2, iNOS, and PYK2. Despite some similarities, there were notable differences in responses to LPS and I+T. For instance, LPS often evoked higher pro-inflammatory gene expression and also increased several anti-inflammatory genes. Second, we compared the ability of two anti-inflammatory, resolving cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), to counteract responses to LPS and I+T.

Changes in the seed rain due to anthropogenic habitat alteration can influence seedling recruitment patterns and affect the evolutionary dynamics of populations. Using a combined endocarp-embryo microsatellite assay of naturally dispersed seeds, we concomitantly quantify the contribution of contemporary pollen and seed dispersal to the genetic structure of the seed rain of the shrub species Pistacia lentiscus L. The study was conducted in two consecutive seasons at four forest fragments embedded in contrasting (connected vs. isolated) landscapes. Interseasonal variation in the parental genetic structure of the seed rain was assessed through analysis of molecular variance, and paternal and maternal correlations and effective parental numbers were computed for different fragments and microhabitats (within fragments) using genetic kinship analysis. Temporal variation in the genetic structure of the dispersed seeds was higher for maternal gametes, reflecting a more temporally variable contribution of individual mother plants to the seed rain, as a potential consequence of masting and/or natural heterogeneity. Higher effective numbers of fathers than mothers were consistently observed in all studied forest fragments and microhabitats, the difference being more pronounced for connected than for isolated fragments. The effective number of mothers, directly influenced by disperser birds\u2019 behavior, was apparently insensitive to fragmentation. Despite potentially high mobility of pollen by wind and seeds by birds, habitat fragmentation could influence the parental structure of dispersed seeds, with potential consequences for the genetic structure of the adult generation.", "doi": "10.5061/dryad.45t51", "publicationDate": "2017-01-25", "dateAvailable": "2017-01-25", "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.45t51", "method": null, "source": "DRYAD", "type_cont": null},

Despite billions of dollars in research funding and the dedicated work of thousands of scientists and clinicians HIV/AIDS has already claimed over 25 million lives.  There are ~33 million people currently living with HIV and  ~2.7 million new infections occurred last year.  Approximately 2.1 million children are currently HIV+, the vast majority of who acquired the virus from their mothers.  While great strides have been made in the development of drugs to treat HIV infection, such medications are expensive and the majority of people who need them currently lack access.  Efforts at developing an HIV vaccine have met with almost relentless failure, and only one human trial has thus far produced modest positive results.  One of the greatest challenges facing HIV vaccine development is the incredible genetic heterogeneity of circulating viral strains, and HIVs ability to rapidly mutate in order to escape immune pressure. \u2767 There is some hope.  HIV transmission is extremely inefficient, often resulting from the outgrowth of a single genetic variant.  This extreme genetic bottleneck implies the action of powerful selective forces, yet there is precious little data available on the genetic and functional properties of variants that successfully establish infection in a new host, and almost no data on how these selective criteria may vary by route of transmission.  An improved understanding of the selective forces acting on viral variants during transmission could open up new strategies to interfere with the process.  By answering the question \u201cwhat defines a winner?\u201d we can refine our approaches to specifically target the viral variants most capable of establishing chronic infection in a susceptible host. \u2767 In this context, mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) represents both an important medical and humanitarian concern, as well as a powerful system in which to study transmission dynamics.  Unlike other forms of transmission, MTCT allows unambiguous identification of the source donor.  Furthermore, MTCT involves three distinct, mutually exclusive, and serial exposures (in utero, during labor and delivery, and postnatally by breastfeeding).  By studying the early-transmitted virus from the infected infants, and comparing those variants to the virus circulating in the chronically infected mothers, we can identify the specific features selected for during transmission and how that selection may vary by exposure.  This knowledge will, in turn, help us unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV transmission, and ultimately provide new targets for intervention. \u2767 In our study we explore the genotypic and phenotypic selection that occurs during transmission of HIV from mother to child.  We define a unique \u2018molecular signature\u2019 for virus transmitted in utero and by breastfeeding.  This study represents, to our knowledge, the first description of transmission-route-specific selection in HIV; and as such permanently alters the way in which MTCT should be approached.  We also describe a series of HIV infected subjects harboring antibody resistant variants previously thought to be extremely rare, but which appear to occur with greater frequency in pregnant women and their infected offspring.  The identification and characterization of these variants has implications for both vaccine development and our understanding of the structure/function of HIV\u2019s envelope protein.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c127-619869", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-619869", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Successful design and implementation of EOR methods are highly dependent on the accuracy by which simulation tools can represent the physics that govern the displacement behavior in a reservoir. In this work, we investigate, and aim to improve the accuracy of some physical models that are frequently used to describe and interpret multiphase flows via compositional reservoir simulation. \u2767 In the simulation of gas injection EOR methods, it is common to use relative permeability values obtained from co-current experiments and it is assumed that the viscous coupling between flowing phases is negligible. In this work we show that Water Alternating Gas (WAG) and Simultaneous Water and Gas (SWAG) injection processes are dominated by counter-current flow in the vertical direction. Previous experimental and simulation studies on counter-current flow have shown that counter-current relative permeability is always less than the co-current relative permeability. Most of the previous studies on the subject of counter-current flow have focused on two-phase flow. In this work we focus on counter-current flow in a three-phase flow system such as WAG and SWAG injection processes. \u2767 We use both co-current and counter-current relative permeability functions in the simulation of these gas injection EOR processes (co-current flow in the horizontal direction and counter-current flow in the vertical direction) and show that the saturation profiles, oil recoveries and gas oil ratios are significantly influenced by the transition of flow from co-current to counter-current mode. Accounting for counter-current relative permeability results in higher oil recovery and lower GOR in all cases. The extent to which the conventional flow model and the flow model that accounts for counter-current relative permeability differ, relies on the properties of the reservoir (i.e. vertical to horizontal permeability ratio) and the history of production and flooding of the reservoir (e.g. initial fluid saturation in the reservoir at the beginning of the WAG/SWAG flood). \u2767 Next, we focus on the phase behavior of fluids in unconventional reservoirs. Despite the large potential of unconventional resources, many unknowns still exist regarding the physics controlling the extraction processes in these settings. These include accurate representation of phase equilibrium in tight formations and effective implementation of relevant models in simulation tools. When a fluid is confined in pore spaces of nanometer size, significant interfacial curvatures may occur that can result in large capillary pressures between the liquid and vapor phases. The pressure difference between the two phases will likely affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium state. Previous efforts have shown that this effect is negligible for conventional reservoirs (with pores in the micron range) and current commercial reservoir simulators commonly ignore the effect of capillary pressure in the VLE calculations. However, experimental and modeling efforts have shown that ignoring capillary pressure in the VLE calculations will not be a valid approximation for unconventional (tight) reservoirs. We analyze the numerical aspects of including capillarity phenomena in VLE calculations, in an effort, to arrive at robust and efficient algorithms for stability analysis that can be used in compositional modeling/simulation of unconventional reservoirs. \u2767 Next, we aim our focus on molecular diffusion and mass transfer during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. Molecular diffusion can play a significant role in oil recovery during gas injection in fractured reservoirs, especially when matrix permeability is low and fracture intensity is high. Diffusion of gas components from a fracture into the matrix extracts oil components from matrix and delays, to some extent, the gas breakthrough. This in turn increases both sweep and displacement efficiencies. \u2767 In current simulation models, molecular diffusion is commonly modeled using a classical Fick\u2019s law approach with constant diffusion coefficients. In the classical Fick\u2019s law approach, the dragging effects (off-diagonal diffusion coefficients) are neglected. In addition, the gas-oil diffusion at the fracture-matrix interface is normally modeled by assuming an average composition at the interface which does not have a sound physical basis. \u2767 We present a dual-porosity model in which the generalized Fick\u2019s law is used to describe molecular diffusion to account for dragging effects. Gas-oil diffusion across the fracture-matrix interface is modeled based on film theory in which the gas in fracture and oil in the matrix are assumed to be at equilibrium at the interface. A novel and consistent matrix-fracture (M-F) transfer function is introduced for gas-oil diffusion based on film theory. Diffusion coefficients are calculated using the Maxwell-Stefan approach and are pressure, temperature and composition dependent. \u2767 Finally, we will discuss a common problem in coarse scale modeling of molecular diffusion in naturally fractured reservoirs. In commercial reservoir simulation tools, transfer rates between the flowing and the stagnant domain in a dual-porosity model are modeled using the Warren and Roots model, in which no attempt is made to solve diffusion equations within each block and quasi-steady state transfer is assumed between the two domains. Previous researchers have shown that such a simplification does not correctly represent the mass transfer between the domains in a dynamic displacement. \u2767 A more accurate approach to modeling transfer rates in such reservoirs would be to further discretize the matrix blocks but such an approach lacks computational efficiency for the purposes of large scale reservoir simulation, because orders of magnitude more computational cells are required for this approach. \u2767 In the final chapter, we present a semi-analytical approach to model multicomponent molecular diffusion within each matrix block in a coarse-scale simulation model and develop equations for time-dependent transfer functions between the flowing and stagnant domains. The time-dependency of the transfer functions are characterized based on the composition of domains. Generalized Fick\u2019s law is used to describe the diffusive fluxes to account for dragging effects between components. Analytical and semi-analytical solutions to the multicomponent mass transfer equations are obtained using the linearized theory of Toor and eigenvalue decomposition of the diffusion coefficient matrix. \u2767 To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed semi-analytical approach, various examples are presented. In these examples the results of the suggested approach are compared to the Warren-root model, analytical solution and high-resolution fine-scale models for 1-D linear and spherical geometries for a variety of fluid compositions.  We observe that our approach (coarse-scale model using time-dependent transfer functions) accurately represents the analytical solution, with far lower CPU time requirement compared to high-resolution fine-scale models. Furthermore, we investigate experimental measurements of mass transfer rates in binary mixtures and further validate the precision of the proposed model by comparison of the results obtained from our model with the experimental data. \u2767 The novel and consistent matrix-fracture transfer function for coarse-scale models, based on semi-analytical solutions to multicomponent mass transfer, overcome the inaccuracies of conventional treatment of diffusion in dual porosity models, while eliminating the need for further discretization of the matrix blocks.

The essential task for the understanding of the regulatory mechanism(s) is thus to determine the temporal and spatial quantitative map of the time-evolving molecular states of the signaling network to enable building a physically reasonable and biologically meaningful model that not only describes the acquired data but also can generate testable hypotheses. Conventional approaches in biological science and bioengineering rely almost invariably on population-averaged measurements of usually a single biomarker at a limited number of fixed time points. The true trajectories of the dynamics of multiple biomarkers of the cellular response and their cell-to-cell variation are thus averaged over and masked. In turn this limits the reliability and scope of the model(s) built upon such measurements. To overcome these limitations, in this dissertation, we introduced and followed the new paradigm of measuring simultaneously in real-time indicators / biomarkers of multiple processes in a statistically large number of individual live cells from the same population under controlled stress over prolonged times. Such an approach, increasingly recognized in recent years as central to pursuing a systems perspective of biological processes, including those underlying disease, demanded the availability of appropriate experimental platform. Fortunately the Madhukar laboratory was embarked upon developing such a platform and this author could join Dr. Siyuan Lu in this effort. Thus a custom-designed high-throughput real-time live-cell imaging platform that allows optical imaging of multiple fluorescence biomarkers while also imaging morphological changes in a network of live cells was developed, tested, and applied to the study of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Specifically, the mitochondria-mediated (i.e. intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) line differentiated RGC-5, induced by elevated hydrostatic pressure is examined via simultaneous imaging of five features: the time-dependant concentration of (1) intracellular Ca2+, (2) caspase-3/7 activation, (3) phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, and the morphological changes of (4) cell body shrinkage and (5) neurite retraction. Simultaneous measurement of five features in apoptosis, and perhaps for any biological process, in a statistically large number of individual live cells under continuous stress is a first. It has enabled the following major findings for apoptosis: (1) resolving a controversy in the literature, the mechanism of the observed apoptotic morphological change of cell body shrinkage at the early stage can now be attributed to the ion channel activities regulating water efflux as evidenced by the strong temporal correlation between the early intracellular Ca2+ elevation and the cell body shrinkage; (2) the first quantitative evidence for significant cell-to-cell variation in the time interval between the onset of Ca2+ elevation at the early stage of apoptosis and the time of caspase-3/7 activation at the later stages of apoptosis and (3) the appearance of multiple stages in PS translocation from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, suggesting more than a single mechanism of PS translocation to be operative in RGC apoptosis under elevated pressure. \u2767 The acquisition of data on the dynamics of five features is not only a first, equally significant, the acquired Ca2+ data have enabled, for the first time, the modeling and analysis of the role of [Ca2+] in apoptosis. Although Ca2+ dynamics in normal healthy cells under physiological conditions has been measured, modeled, and analyzed for quite some time, the model proposed and analyzed here is the first one for [Ca2+] dynamics during apoptosis. The physical model proposed is guided by the seminal work of Boehning et al. [Nat. Cell Biol. 5 (2003)] who showed the significance of the cytochrome c released by the mitochondria for impacting the free cytosolic [Ca2+] via its binding to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Specifically, the impact of cytochrome c binding to IP3R is modeled as a change in the IP3R opening probability expression employed by Mak et al. [PNAS, 95 (1998)] in the modeling of [Ca2+] dynamics in non-apoptotic cells. The model provides a qualitative understanding of the [Ca2+] dynamics in apoptosis for reasonable values of the parameters involved. \u2767 As PS translocation gives rise to an increase in its concentration at the cell surface, we also carried out a unique study utilizing combined NSOM-AFM (Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy - Atomic force microscopy) that allowed simultaneous imaging of the 3-dimensional topography of the cell surface and the local density of PS as manifest in the fluorescence intensity of Annexin-V conjugated to the PS measured at the nanoscale beyond the diffraction limit. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient 0.69) between the geometrical height and the density of the PS on the surface of the RGC-5 cell membrane is found. It suggests that this may be Nature\u2019s way of signaling for and enabling a means for effective binding of the associated receptors in phagocytes to the translocated PS in the apoptotic cell. \u2767 To investigate the very origin of RGC apoptosis under elevated pressure, we undertook examination of the neurotrophin deprivation hypothesis\u2014namely that the blockage of neurotrophin uptake/transport through axon induces apoptosis in RGCs under elevated pressure. This was carried out employing dye as well as QD-tagged neurotrophins and for cells cultured in custom-designed microfluidic chips that enable isolation of the cell soma and processes. This ensures unambiguous measurements of spatially separated uptake regions and axonal transport of the neurotrophins. For the uptake studies, the cells employed are the differentiated RGC-5 cell line whereas for the axonal transport studies only the neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells were employed as these provide mature axons (unlike RGC-5 neurites which are not sufficiently mature). Reduction in the number of neurotrophin uptaken into the differentiated RGC-5 cells and more neurotrophins localized in the neurites were found under the elevated pressure of 100 mmHg compared to the cells under no elevated pressure. The neurotrophin transport in the neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells revealed a typical stop-and-go behavior. This suggests that the elevated pressure not only inhibits the overall uptake of the neurotrophins into RGCs but also potentially the transport through neurites in RGCs, thus providing the first evidence supporting the neurotrophin deprivation hypothesis of apoptosis.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c127-662046", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-662046", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

A great majority of methods currently available for assessing DNA methylation patterns focuses on molecular profiling of large volumes of cells and, thus, is not ideal for use in pathology, where understanding variations in methylation profiles of individual cells within a population is important. Although single cell profiling may be possible in newer generation microarray-based assays, sequencing of methylation patterns remains highly time-consuming and very costly, when applied in cell-by-cell fashion. Towards the ultimate goal of creating a high-throughput assay that could be used in translational medicine, imaging-based, quantitative, and cytometric analysis of DNA methylation patterns entitled \u201c3-Dimensional Quantitative DNA Methylation Imaging (3D-qDMI)\u201d has been developed. This dissertation investigates the feasibility of using such assay to delineate and quantify in situ global DNA methylation features, such as nuclear load and spatial distribution of methylated cytosine (MeC). \u2767 3D-qDMI entails highly specific immunofluorescence methods, high-resolution imaging via confocal laser-scanning microscopy, and dedicated software package designed to analyze fluorescence intensity patterns at both the cellular and population levels. Immunofluorescence staining of specimens is performed by monoclonal anti-MeC primary antibody, which has been shown to possess both the desired specificity and sensitivity needed for a DNA methylation assay. The specimens were counter-stained with DAPI, a non-specific dye, to visualize the inhomogeneous distribution of genomic DNA. The counter-stain establishes the baseline of spatial genomic density, which was then used to qualify and quantify MeC fluorescence. The stained specimens were imaged by high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy, which has a lateral resolution of ~ 150 nm and an axial resolution of ~ 500 nm for the conditions used in this dissertation. The images obtained were analyzed with automated and high-throughput software specifically developed to meet the needs of 3D-qDMI without compromising data reliability. The image analysis methods involve a pre-processing step to delineate nuclear regions of interest (ROIs) and three different analytical modules to assess both cellular-level topological co-distribution of DAPI and MeC signals and population-level homogeneity. Each of the novel analytical modules was validated using sets of images with explicitly known characteristics. These analytical modules work independent from each other and have been designed to be flexible, so that the end user has the options to choose which specific modules to run. \u2767 3D-qDMI was then tested for its ability to distinguish and discriminate cells based on their DNA methylation patterns, in cells with different proliferative capacities. Primary cells were cultured until replicative senescence was reached, while cancer cells were grown to provide sufficient samples, as necessary, to identify their growth rates. Separately, stress-induced premature senescence was studied via application of H\u2082O\u2082.  Results from these studies showed that as the proliferative capacity of cells decreased, global hypomethylation and chromatin re-organization were observed. Global hypomethylation could also be identified in cancer cells, but distinct differences could be observed between cancer cells and primary cells reaching senescence for various topological parameters used in 3D-qDMI. These results suggest that these differences could be utilized in discriminating primary cells populations from cancer cell populations. Overall, the results from these feasibility studies confirmed that an imaging-based assay can be utilized to discern DNA methylation patterns of different cells. \u2767 This dissertation demonstrates that an advanced optical imaging-based assay can be used to assess DNA methylation patterns at both single cell-level and population-level. The results found through 3D-qDMI were on par with previously published findings from molecular-based assays. 3D-qDMI is not developed to replace molecular-based assays: the current methods as presented in this dissertation cannot identify which DNA sequences are methylated nor determine the absolute number of MeC residues in the genome. Instead, 3D-qDMI was developed to address the need for a high-throughput, cost-effective assay for DNA methylation for use in pathology. Unlike the commonly available cellular phenotyping methods for tumor cells in biopsy samples, which rely on a static, morphology-based evaluation by a trained physician, 3D-qDMI delivers a dynamic and activity-based picture of cells. Further studies and development of the methods presented in this dissertation should allow for the ability to distinguish \u201chealthy\u201d cells from \u201cdiseased\u201d cells, which could drastically change how clinical pathology is current performed.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c127-631915", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c127-631915", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Successful design and implementation of gas injection processes (mainly CO\u2082) rely in part on the accuracy by which the available simulation tools can represent the physics that govern the displacement behavior in a reservoir. \u2767 In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the accuracy of some physical models that are frequently used to describe and interpret dispersive mixing and mass transfer in compositional reservoir simulation. The calculations from compositional simulation are compared with the experimental observations. \u2767 A quaternary analog fluid system (alcohol\u2010water\u2010hydrocarbon) that mimics the phase behavior of CO\u2082\u2010hydrocarbon mixtures at high pressure and temperature has been designed in our research group. A porous medium was designed using Teflon materials to ensure that the analog oil acts as the wetting phase, and the properties of the porous medium were characterized in terms of porosity and permeability. Relative permeability and interfacial tension measurements were also performed to delineate interactions between the fluid system and the porous medium. Displacement experiments at First\u2010contact miscible (FCM), near\u2010miscible and multicontact miscible (MCM) conditions were consequently performed (Rastegar, 2010). \u2767 The effluent concentrations from two\u2010component FCM displacement experiments exhibit a tailing behavior that is attributed to imperfect sweep of the porous medium: A feature that is not captured by normal dispersion models. To represent this behavior in displacement calculations, we use dual\u2010porosity (DP) models including mass transfer between flowing and stagnant porosities. The 4\u2010component two\u2010phase displacement experiments (near\u2010miscible and MCM) are consequently simulated using the DP models constructed based on observations from FCM displacements. \u2767 We demonstrate that the accuracy of our displacement calculations relative to the experimental observations is sensitive to the selected models for dispersive mixing, mass transfer between flowing and stagnant porosities, and IFT scaling of relative permeability functions. We also demonstrate that numerical calculations substantially agree with the experimental observations for some physical models with limited need for model parameter adjustment. \u2767 The second part of this thesis is devoted to diffusion and matrix\u2010fracture interactions during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. Molecular diffusion can play a significant role in oil recovery during gas injection in fractured reservoirs, especially when matrix permeability is low and fracture intensity is high. Diffusion of gas components from a fracture into the matrix extracts oil components from matrix and delays, to some extent, the gas breakthrough. This in turn increases both sweep and displacement efficiencies. \u2767 In current simulation models, molecular diffusion is commonly modeled using a classical Fick's law approach with constant diffusion coefficients. In the classical Fick's law approach, the dragging effects (off\u2010diagonal diffusion coefficients) are neglected. In addition, the gas\u2010oil diffusion at the fracture\u2010matrix interface is normally modeled by assuming an average composition at the interface which does not have a sound physical basis. \u2767 In this work, we present a dual\u2010porosity model in which the generalized Fick's law is used for molecular diffusion to account for the dragging effects; and gas\u2010oil diffusion at the fracture\u2010matrix interface is modeled based on film theory in which the gas in fracture and oil in the matrix are assumed to be at equilibrium. A novel matrix\u2010fracture transfer function is introduced for gas\u2010oil diffusion based on film theory. Diffusion coefficients are calculated using the Maxwell\u2010Stefan model and are pressure, temperature and composition dependent. A time\u2010dependent transfer function is used for matrix\u2010fracture exchange in which the shape factor is adjusted using a boost factor to differentiate between the transfer rate at early and late times. \u2767 Field\u2010scale examples are used to show that our approach, which is based on a sophisticated physical model for gas\u2010oil diffusion (film theory), gives significantly different results from the conventional approach. It is also demonstrated that the dragging effects (off\u2010diagonal diffusion coefficients) and time\u2010dependency of matrix\u2010fracture transfer function can moderately impact the oil recovery during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. We also show that miscibility is not developed in the matrix blocks even at pressures above minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) when molecular diffusion is the main recovery mechanism during gas injection in fractured reservoirs. \u2767 In recent years, coalbed methane has become an important source of energy in the United States. Since primary production techniques typically recover less than half of the methane in a coalbed, enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery processes are needed in which CO\u2082 and/or N\u2082 are injected into the coalbed to recover more CH\u2084. \u2767 One of the main mechanisms that govern the dynamics of ECBM recovery processes is the sorption of gases onto the coal surfaces. Despite the well\u2010documented complexity of multicomponent sorption phenomena, adsorption and desorption of CH\u2084/CO\u2082/N\u2082 mixtures in the porous coal is commonly modeled with the extended Langmuir model. The extended Langmuir model has been proven unable to accurately describe the multicomponent sorption that is central to ECBM recovery processes and, therefore, more sophisticated sorption models are needed. \u2767 In the third part of this thesis we apply potential theory to describe the multicomponent sorption of relevance to ECBM processes. In this approach for modeling multicomponent sorption, each component is assumed to be affected by a characteristic potential field emitted by the coal surface. We discuss the implementation of potential theory with emphasis on the simulation of ECBM processes where computational efficiency and accuracy must be balanced. The model must be solved by an iterative scheme, and is hence more computationally expensive than the extended Langmuir approach. \u2767 The results and analysis presented in this work demonstrate that the application of potential theory of sorption to modeling of ECBM recovery processes can improve the accuracy of calculations. However, the additional complexity of the model and the associated increase in the computational efforts may not balance the gain in accuracy sufficiently to warrant application in general purpose reservoir simulation.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-446031", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-446031", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null},

Intrigued by how natural language influences consumer\u2019s choice, this study aims to examine how consumer\u2019s contexts differ across different geographical area. A total of 8740 tweets were collected in a period of 1 month (March to April 2019) from Twitter Archiver and are classified under 6 continents; Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania. Tweets were analyzed and assisted with the corpus analysis tool, WMatrix. Our main goal is to test the 8 motivations and also address the gap of existing literatures, who tend to ignore the importance of culture in choosing accommodation. Findings confirm that Airbnb users tend to consider motivations like price, social interaction, location, opinion, materialism, photo, demographic and communication while choosing Airbnb accommodation. Surprisingly, Animals (dogs, cats) and cultural differences were also identified as a strong motivation for certain users. Yet, negative sentiment from tweets was mostly caused by noise. Our results give an insight to Airbnb hosts in order to analyze their current market situation and improve their revenue. The paper also shows imperative motivations that hosts might need to consider in a guideline prototype.

This dataset comes with our APIs list configured into \"jubundler/apis/apis.json\" but you are free to include and exclude to APIs you want to analyze.\n\nThis project consumes a list of API clients which are mined with the BOA language and infrastructure (check Related Links).\n\nBasic workflow is described bellow:\n* If you do not want to perform the analysis for a API of your choice, skip to step 8 *\n\n1. Choose your target API for analysis;\n2. Go to \"junbundler/apis\" folder and create a directory for your own API as follows:\n---- junbundler/\n-------- apis/\n------------ {API_NAME}/\n---------------- data/\n-------------------- input/\n-------------------- output/\n----------------- scripts/\n----------------- source/\n\n3. Download your API source and copy it into data/source inside your API folder. Compacted files should be extracted;\n4. Collect the API base package (i.e., for Google Gson API the base package is 'com.google.gson');\n5. Copy the template script for API clients mining is available on \"jubundler/scripts/boa-imports-template.boa\" and change the target package name with yours;\n6. Go to the BOA website (see Related Links), request a user account. Log in, go to the \"Run Examples\" page and submit the code from step 4;\n6.1 Your job will be executed on the BOA infrastructure for a while. Once it is finished, download the output file (if there is any) on the \"Job List\" page;\n6.2 Copy the BOA output file into your API data/input folder with the following name: imports_[API_NAME].txt (e.g., for Gson it would be imports_Gson.txt);\n7. Edit the \"junbundler/apis/apis.json\" file including an entry for your API. A detailed description of each key of this file can be found in the \"Source\" folder of this dataset.\n8. Run the JUnbundler class (\"junbundler/src/main/java/JUnbundler.java\").\n\n# About execution and results:\n\n- This program execution includes large text files parsing, Trinagular Dependency Matrix construction and API source code structure analysis, thus it can take a while to complete, from several minutes up to few days, depending on your machine specifications and target APIs for analysis. Be aware that APIs which yields huge usage files may take a lot of memory to build Trinagular Dependency Matrix. It's recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM to run this program with the current API set.\n- All result files will be located in the \"studies\" folder under the project root directory with the name \"unbundling-study-{EXECUTION_TIMESTAMP}\", where {EXECUTION_TIMESTAMP} correspond to the time the program finished.\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\nIf you have any issues while running the JUnbundler program or need assistance, please contact us.\t", "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

Each observation represents an individual well in a specific year. \n\nNebraska Data:\nGroundwater pumping (acre-feet), irrigated acres, pumping hours, and energy use (kwh) data are downloaded from the RRCA website (http://www.republicanrivercompact.org/). Energy use efficiency (kwh/acre-inch), pumping cost ($/acre-inch), and well yield (gallons per minute) were then calculated based on the groundwater and energy use data. The original daily weather data used to calculate growing season (June through September) precipitation (inches) and evapotranspiration (inches) are obtained from Daymet (https://daymet.ornl.gov/).\n\nColorado Data:\nAnnual groundwater pumping (acre-feet), well yield, and water-energy use conversion factors are available at the well-level via the Colorado Decisions Support System (https://dwr.state.co.us/Tools/Structures).  The original daily weather data used to calculate growing season (June through September) precipitation and evapotranspiration are obtained from Daymet (https://daymet.ornl.gov/).\n\nThis data is unique in that well yield is observed or can be inferred. Well yield is a variable that has not been observed at the well level with accuracy in other groundwater use data. Using this unique data, we sought to answer the following two main questions:\n\nResearch hypothesis 1: Ignoring (omitting) well yield leads to biased estimation of the impact of pumping costs on groundwater demand (price elasticity of demand for groundwater).\n\nResearch hypothesis 2: Well yield is a key determinant of annual groundwater use volumes for agricultural production\n\nWe found that ignoring (omitting) well yield severely over-estimates the importance of pumping costs in groundwater demand regression analysis. This indicates that water pricing may be much less effective as a tool to conserve water than previously considered. Finally, we found well yield is a much more influential determinant of groundwater use compared to pumping cost. These general results are consistent for Nebraska and Colorado.\n\n", "doi": "10.17632/2csdvyry9t.1", "publicationDate": "2019-08-21", "dateAvailable": "2019-08-21", "version": "1", "accessRights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2csdvyry9t", "method": "Steps to reproduce the results can be found at the beginning of the Replication.html file.

In addition, a trained veterinarian in gait scoring assessed the locomotion of all the lactating cows at the farms. The main interest we had with the present research was to know how much the farmers knew about lameness in dairy cows, what was the relative importance of lameness within the dairy herd common health issues, how aware the farmers were regarding the occurrence of this problem, and what preventative measures were used at the farms. \nWe found that lameness was a common issue at the visited farms and also that farmers found lameness a secondary health problem at their farms. The farmers made estimates of lameness prevalence that were lower than the veterinarian's estimates. The farmers did not practice commonly preventative measures to avoid the occurrence of lameness. \nThis information is important in order to design preventative veterinary approach in small-scale dairy farms in Brazil and may be useful to think on building population medicine strategies in small-scale dairy farms in another countries.

Experiment 1 showed more errors in stress identification when f0 peaks and stressed syllables were not aligned \u2013 despite phonological association of pitch accent and stressed syllable. Erroneous responses revealed a response bias towards the syllable with the f0 peak. In a visual-world eye-tracking study (Experiment 2), listeners fixated a stress competitor with initial stress more when the spoken target, which had penultimate stress, was realized with an early-peak accent (f0 peak preceding stressed syllable), compared to a condition with the f0 peak on the stressed syllable. Hence, high-pitched unstressed syllables are temporarily interpreted as stressed \u2013 a process directly affecting lexical activation. To investigate whether this stress competitor activation is guided by the frequent co-occurrence of high f0 and lexical stress, Experiment 3 increased the frequency of low-pitched stressed syllables in the immediate input. The effect of intonation on competitor fixations disappeared. The paper discusses these findings with respect to a frequency-based mechanism and their implications for the nature of f0 processing.\n\nOn this platform, stimuli (wav-files) for all experiments are provided, along with datasets (raw data for stress judgements, Experiment 1, and eye-tracking experiments (Experiments 2 and 3)) and a R-Markdown file showing all steps in the statistical analysis (Exp. 1-3).\n\nReference: Zahner, Kutscheid & Braun (in press).

This produced a collection of 2,869 tweets by 1,684 unique users.\nMany of these tweets resulted from (multiple) interactions between users. For example, 823 of our 2,869 original tweets (28.7%) were replies, 414 (14.4%) were retweets, and 249 (8.7%) were quotes. Many of these statuses would not have been written without an original tweet to retweet, quote, or reply to. As we wanted our data to reflect this context, we retrieved the (chains of) tweets that triggered the retweets, quotes, and replies in our initial set, resulting in 2,437 extra tweets by 1,197 unique users, of whom 324 unique users were present in our initial data set.

However, connections between non-tweeting and tweeting users make up a large part of the digital infrastructure that facilitates the circulation of vaccine-related content and can be used to reveal the underlying social context. Therefore, for each of the unique Twitter accounts in our earlier-retrieved set of tweets (the authors), we retrieved all their followers (accounts following the authors: 34,135,154) and followees (accounts followed by the authors: 1,288,618). \n\nWe were interested in identifying online communities based on shared interests (who the authors are following) and shared audiences (who the authors are followed by). We therefore excluded followers and followees who were not connected to at least 15 authors. We determined this cut-off point by examining the distribution of the number of connections with authors and arrived at our ultimate network size to stay within the limits of what our hardware and software were capable of handling in terms of visualization. Ultimately, our network included 121,623 Twitter accounts and 3,706,124 connections. We used the Louvain algorithm to detect communities in our network. This is known as a fast, but relatively accurate, method to detect communities in large-scale networks.\n", "doi": "10.17632/fjvk93bc5m.1", "publicationDate": "2019-04-25", "dateAvailable": "2019-04-25", "version": "1", "accessRights": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0", "containerURI": "https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fjvk93bc5m", "method": null, "source": "MENDELEY_DATA", "type_cont": "article"},

In addition, calyx terminals are morphologically diverse which impacts vesicle release properties and synaptic plasticity. Mitochondria influence synaptic plasticity through calcium buffering and are crucial for providing the energy required for synaptic transmission. Therefore, it has been postulated that mitochondrial levels increase during development and contribute to the morphological-functional diversity in the mature calyx. However, the developmental profile of mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distribution at the calyx of Held remains unclear. To provide insight on this, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HdAd) that expresses the genetically encoded peroxidase marker for mitochondria, mito-APEX2, at the mouse calyx of Held. We developed protocols to detect labeled mitochondria for use with serial block face scanning electron microscopy to carry out semi-automated segmentation of mitochondria, high-throughput whole terminal reconstruction and presynaptic ultrastructure in mice of either sex. Subsequently, we measured mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distributions at the immature postnatal day 7 (P7) and the mature (P21) calyx. We found an increase of mitochondria volumes in terminals and axons from P7 to P21 but did not observe differences between stalk and swelling subcompartments in the mature calyx. Based on these findings, we propose that mitochondrial volumes and synaptic localization developmentally increase to support high firing rates required in the initial stages of auditory information processing.\n\nData are sorted by the figures they appear in.

During our previous experiment (RB1620008) we found that the change in the temperature dependence of the muon spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) may not be due to the glass transition, as previously understood but instead may be due to a change from the delta\u0096relaxation to the gamma\u0096relaxation dominating.

In the past decade, nanoscale materials have made significant commercial impacts, which will potentially lead to the next industrial revolution. The interest lies in the novel and promising features nanoscale materials exhibit due to their confined sizes. However, not all novel behaviors are understood or controllable. Many uncontrollable parameters, e.g. defects and dangling bonds, are known to hinder the performance of nanodevices. Solutions to these problems rely on our understanding of fundamental elements in nanoscience: isolated individual nanostructures and their assemblies. \u2767 In this dissertation, we will address atomistic foundations of several problems of technological importance in nanoscience. Specifically, three basic problems are discussed: (1) embrittlement of nanocrystalline metal; (2) novel thermo-mechanical behaviors of nanowires (NWs); and (3) planar defect generation in NWs. With a scalable algorithm implemented on massively parallel computing platforms and various data mining methods, MD simulations can provide valuable insights into these problems. \u2767 An essential role of sulfur segregation-induced amorphization of crystalline nickel was recently discovered experimentally, but the atomistic mechanism of the amorphization remains unexplained. Our MD simulations reveal that the large steric size of sulfur impurity causes strong sulfur-sulfur interaction mediated by lattice distortion, which leads to amorphization near the percolation threshold at the sulfur-sulfur network in nickel crystal. The generality of the mechanism due to the percolation of an impurity network is further confirmed by a model binary system. \u2767 In our study of novel behaviors of semiconductor NWs, MD simulations construct a rich size-temperature \u2018phase diagram\u2019 for the mechanical response of a zinc-oxide NW under tension. For smaller diameters and higher temperatures, novel transitions are found from brittle cleavage to structural transformation-mediated brittle cleavage to ductile failure. Atomistic mechanisms of the unique nano-thermo-mechanical behavior are elucidated as a consequence of surface-structural relaxation, which in particular predicts spontaneous formation of a core/shell structure under tension. The phase diagram resolves controversies between previous experiments and theory, and the predicted \u2018intrinsic\u2019 core/shell structure may find novel device applications. \u2767 Generation of stacking faults (SFs) during the growth of NWs is a major concern for the efficiency of NW-based devices such as solar cells. MD simulation of a [111]-oriented gallium arsenide NW reveals an atomistic mechanism of SF generation. Spatial distribution of the adatom energy on the (111)B top surface exhibits a novel core/shell structure due to the contraction of atomic bonds at the sidewall surfaces, where SFs are preferentially nucleated in the shell. A nucleation growth model incorporating the core/shell mechanism suggests a size and growth-condition controlled approach for SF-free growth of NWs.", "doi": "10.25549/usctheses-c3-219293", "publicationDate": "2015-01-01", "dateAvailable": null, "version": null, "accessRights": null, "containerURI": "https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-c3-219293", "method": null, "source": "usc.dl", "type_cont": null}
